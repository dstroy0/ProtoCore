 * @file SSHReverseTunnel.ino
 * @brief Reverse-SSH tunnel: reach a device behind NAT over a public relay.
 *
 * The mirror of the SSH server. The device dials OUT to a relay with a public
 * address (any OpenSSH host), authenticates with its own ed25519 key, and asks
 * the relay to forward a port back (tcpip-forward, RFC 4254 sec 7.1 - the `ssh -R`
 * seam). A connection to the relay's forwarded port is tunnelled to a local
 * service on the device - here its own web server on :80. So the device stays
 * reachable from anywhere without a public IP or an inbound firewall hole.
 *
 * On the relay (a normal OpenSSH server), after adding the device's key below:
 *     curl http://127.0.0.1:8022/        # -> the device's web server, over the tunnel
 *
 * KEY POINT - run the tunnel in its OWN task with enough stack. The handshake's
 * field arithmetic (curve25519/ed25519, and ML-KEM if PROTOCORE_ENABLE_PQC_KEX) runs
 * in the caller's task and peaks at ~10.5 KB (classical) or ~16 KB (hybrid).
 * loop()'s default 8 KB is NOT enough - create a dedicated >= 20 KB task and call
 * begin()+poll() from it (begin() also claims a private scratch arena for that
 * task, so poll() must run in the same task).
 *
 * Provision once: build, open the serial monitor, copy the printed
 * "ssh-ed25519 ..." public key into the relay's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, and set
 * RELAY_HOST / HOST_PIN below. Get the pin (SHA-256 of the relay's host-key blob):
 *     awk '{print $2}' /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub | base64 -d | sha256sum
