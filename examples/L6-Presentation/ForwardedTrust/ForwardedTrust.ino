 * @file ForwardedTrust.ino
 * @brief Key the auth lockout on the real client behind a trusted reverse proxy
 *        (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_FORWARDED_TRUST).
 *
 * When the device sits behind a reverse proxy / load balancer, every request arrives from the proxy's
 * one TCP address, so a per-IP brute-force lockout would lock out EVERY client at once (one abuser
 * trips it for all) or be useless. This keys the lockout on the ORIGINAL client address the proxy
 * reports in `Forwarded` (RFC 7239) / `X-Forwarded-For` - but ONLY when the request's real TCP peer is
 * a proxy you have explicitly trusted, because that header is client-spoofable. A direct, untrusted
 * client's header is ignored, so it can neither dodge its own lockout nor frame another address.
 *
 * Register each trusted upstream with protocore_forwarded_trust_add_cidr(). The accept-time throttle and the
 * IP allowlist deliberately keep using the real TCP source.
 *
 * NOTE: enable the flags for the whole build (a .ino #define does not reach the separately compiled
 * library). PlatformIO: build_flags = -DPROTOCORE_ENABLE_AUTH_LOCKOUT=1 -DPROTOCORE_ENABLE_FORWARDED_TRUST=1.
 * Arduino IDE: already set in the build_opt.h beside this sketch, so it builds as-is.
 *
 * Try (from a host inside the trusted CIDR, standing in for the proxy):
 *   # lock out one client, keyed on its forwarded address:
 *   curl -u admin:wrong -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.7'  http://<ip>/secret   # ...x THRESHOLD -> 429
 *   # a DIFFERENT forwarded client is unaffected (per-client keying, not per-proxy):
 *   curl -u admin:wrong -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 198.51.100.9' http://<ip>/secret   # 401, not 429
