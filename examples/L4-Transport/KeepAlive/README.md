# KeepAlive - HTTP/1.1 persistent connections

**Layer:** L4 Transport · **Build flags:** `PROTOCORE_ENABLE_KEEPALIVE`

## What this example teaches

By default the server answers one request per TCP connection and closes it
(`Connection: close`). With keep-alive enabled, one connection serves many
requests - the big win when a browser loads a page plus its assets, or a client
polls an endpoint. The crucial point: **it is transparent to your handlers.** You
write the same routes; the server decides keep-alive vs close and emits the right
`Connection` header.

**The behavior rules.** Keep-alive follows the HTTP spec, with safety bounds:

- HTTP/1.1: the connection stays open unless the client sends `Connection: close`.
- HTTP/1.0: it closes unless the client sends `Connection: keep-alive`.
- Error responses (400/413/414) always close - the next request boundary is unknown after a parse error.
- Each connection serves at most `PROTOCORE_KEEPALIVE_MAX_REQUESTS`, then closes.
- Idle connections are still reclaimed by the `conn_timeout` sweep.

**There is no API to learn.** Enabling the flag changes the transport behavior;
the handlers below are ordinary. The `/time` route exists just so a client can
poll repeatedly over the same socket and watch it being reused:

```cpp
server.on("/time", HttpMethod::HTTP_GET, [](uint8_t id, HttpReq *) {
    char buf[32];
    snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "uptime_ms=%lu", (unsigned long)millis());
    server.send(id, 200, "text/plain", buf);
});
```

**Build-flag note.** `PROTOCORE_ENABLE_KEEPALIVE` must reach the library build, so
pass it as a `build_flag` (an in-sketch `#define` only affects the sketch). You
can also tune `PROTOCORE_KEEPALIVE_MAX_REQUESTS` the same way.

## Build and run

```sh
pio ci --board=esp32dev --project-option="framework=arduino" \
  --project-option="build_flags=-DPROTOCORE_ENABLE_KEEPALIVE=1" \
  --lib="." examples/L4-Transport/KeepAlive/KeepAlive.ino
```

```sh
curl -v http://<ip>/                              # note "Connection: keep-alive"
curl -v http://<ip>/ http://<ip>/time http://<ip>/   # one socket serves all three
```
