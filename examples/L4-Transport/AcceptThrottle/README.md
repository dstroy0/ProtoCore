# AcceptThrottle - global connection-flood defense

**Layer:** L4 Transport · **Build flags:** `PROTOCORE_ENABLE_ACCEPT_THROTTLE`

## What this example teaches

This is a build-time defense, not an API. When enabled, the accept callback
rejects new connections once more than `PROTOCORE_ACCEPT_THROTTLE_MAX` have been
accepted within `PROTOCORE_ACCEPT_THROTTLE_WINDOW_MS` - a global fixed window using
two counters, no per-IP table. It bounds connection churn (reconnect/brute-force
floods) on top of the already-bounded connection pool. The sketch's only job is
to show that enabling the flag is all it takes.

**Zero runtime surface.** There is nothing to call - the throttle lives in the
accept path. The handler is a plain route; the defense is active simply because
the flag was compiled in:

```cpp
server.on("/", HttpMethod::HTTP_GET, [](uint8_t id, HttpReq *) { server.send(id, 200, "text/plain", "throttled server"); });
server.begin(80); // the accept throttle is active automatically when the flag is built in
```

**Tuning.** Set the two knobs as build flags alongside the enable flag - for
example a window of 1000 ms and a cap of 20 accepts/window:

```text
build_flags = -DPROTOCORE_ENABLE_ACCEPT_THROTTLE=1 -DPROTOCORE_ACCEPT_THROTTLE_MAX=20 -DPROTOCORE_ACCEPT_THROTTLE_WINDOW_MS=1000
```

For a per-source-IP throttle (so one noisy host cannot starve everyone), see
[PerIpThrottle](../PerIpThrottle).

## Build and run

```sh
pio ci --board=esp32dev --project-option="framework=arduino" \
  --project-option="build_flags=-DPROTOCORE_ENABLE_ACCEPT_THROTTLE=1" \
  --lib="." examples/L4-Transport/AcceptThrottle/AcceptThrottle.ino
```

Hammer it with many rapid connections (e.g. `ab -n 500 -c 50 http://<ip>/`) and
watch excess connections get refused at accept time.
