// PowerGovernor - clock the SoC to what the work, the die temperature, and the supply allow.
//
// network_drivers/physical/radio_power owns the radio and server/sleep_sched decides how long to sleep. Neither
// owns the SoC itself, which is where the rest of the power budget goes. This governor answers one
// question every tick: what should the CPU clock be right now.
//
//   scaling    idle work runs at the floor - spinning a 240 MHz core to poll an idle socket is the
//              easiest power win on this part
//   thermal    a hot die clocks down, and the restore threshold is LOWER than the throttle one, so
//              a part sitting exactly at the limit does not oscillate between full speed and floor
//   brownout   a board that just browned out comes up at the floor for a settle window instead of
//              slamming back into the load that collapsed its supply and boot-looping
//   gating     a build with no BLE can hand back the Bluetooth power domain outright
//
// Precedence is deliberate: brownout beats thermal beats load. A board that cannot hold its supply
// must not be clocked up just because it is busy, and neither must a hot one.
//
// GET /power  -> {"cpu_mhz":80,"throttled":false,"recovering":false,"temp_c":48}
// GET /busy   -> burns CPU for a moment so you can watch the clock climb and settle back
//
