// MdnsAdaptive - keep the device discoverable on a crowded 2.4 GHz channel without adding to the noise.
//
// An mDNS record lapses from network caches at its TTL, so a device has to re-announce to stay
// discoverable. But hammering announces on a busy channel just adds collisions. This ties three
// shipped pieces together so the announce cadence tracks the air:
//
//   promiscuous capture (services/radio/promisc)  -> a live frame count = RF contention
//   beacon scheduler (network_drivers/application/mdns_adaptive) -> backs the interval off when busy, recovers when quiet
//   mDNS TXT re-apply (network_drivers/application/mdns_service) -> re-announces with no goodbye (a refresh, not an evict)
//
// The contention signal comes from promiscuous mode - a radio-layer callback pinned to the station's
// OWN channel - not from a second socket on UDP 5353. That distinction matters: a second 5353 bind
// turns the ESP-IDF responder announce-only (it appears in a browse but stops resolving). Promiscuous
// capture does not touch the responder's sockets, so the record keeps resolving while the count runs.
//
// GET /mdns  -> {"interval_ms":N,"contention":N,"announces":N,"channel":N}
//
// Watch it from a Linux box on the same LAN:
//   avahi-resolve -n adaptive.local            # the A record
//   avahi-browse -rt _http._tcp                # SRV + TXT still resolve while capture runs
//
// This owns promiscuous mode, so it cannot run alongside the wifi_sniffer live channel-hop binding.
