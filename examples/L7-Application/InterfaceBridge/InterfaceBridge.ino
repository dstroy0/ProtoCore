 * @file InterfaceBridge.ino
 * @brief Turn the ESP32 into a network<->hardware-bus device server (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_IFACE_BRIDGE).
 *
 * Map a listen `x.x.x.x:nnnn` to a UART, an SPI chip-select, or an I2C address, so a network client
 * that connects to the port is transparently bridged onto that bus. Two payload models:
 *
 *   - STREAM (UART): raw bidirectional passthrough - a classic serial-device server / ser2net. Bytes
 *     the client sends go out the UART; bytes the UART receives come back to the client. No framing.
 *   - TRANSACTION (SPI / I2C, also usable for UART): the client sends framed write-then-read requests
 *         uint16 write_len (big-endian) || uint16 read_len (big-endian) || write_bytes[write_len]
 *     and gets back the read_len bytes clocked off the bus. This is what master-initiated buses need.
 *
 * Wiring mirrors the relay: `listen(port, ProtoConn::PROTO_BRIDGE)` opens the port, then
 * `protocore_iface_bridge_publish()` binds it to a target and brings the bus up. The server poll loop does the rest.
 *
 * Edit the lines marked "CHANGE ME", flash, open Serial @ 115200, then from another machine:
 *   - UART stream:  `nc <board-ip> 2323`  (type; it goes out UART1, replies come back)
 *   - SPI/I2C txn:  send a 4-byte header + write bytes; read read_len bytes back. Part 2 of the
 *     README shows a one-line Python client.
 *
 * SECURITY: a published port is a direct pipe to the bus, with no authentication at this layer. Only
 * expose it on a trusted interface / behind an upstream ACL.
 *
 * NOTE (PlatformIO): the bridge is compiled into the *library*, so the flag must reach the whole
 * build: `build_flags = -DPROTOCORE_ENABLE_IFACE_BRIDGE=1`. In the Arduino IDE it is set in build_opt.h.
