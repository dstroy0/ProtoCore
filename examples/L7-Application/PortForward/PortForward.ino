/**
 * @file PortForward.ino
 * @brief Publish an internal service through the ESP32 with the TCP relay / DNAT (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_RELAY).
 *
 * The board fronts a port: anything that connects to the ESP32 on FRONT_PORT is relayed to an
 * internal `host:port` that the board can reach, and the return path comes back automatically. This
 * is DNAT / reverse port forwarding - e.g. expose a machine on a locked-down segment through the
 * device that bridges the two networks.
 *
 * Wiring is two calls: `listen(FRONT_PORT, ProtoConn::PROTO_RELAY)` opens the front port, and
 * `protocore_relay_publish()` binds it to the origin. The server's own poll loop pumps the bytes.
 *
 * Edit the lines marked "CHANGE ME" below, flash, and open Serial @ 115200. Then, from another
 * machine, connect to the board on FRONT_PORT and you reach the origin service.
 *
 * SECURITY: this forwards to whatever origin you publish, with no authentication of the inbound
 * side. Only publish trusted internal targets, and keep FRONT_PORT off untrusted networks.
 *
 * NOTE (PlatformIO): the relay is compiled into the *library*, so the flag must reach the whole
 * build: `build_flags = -DPROTOCORE_ENABLE_RELAY=1`. In the Arduino IDE it is set for you in build_opt.h.
