 * @file MeshCache.ino
 * @brief Share a warm edge cache across a fleet (PC_ENABLE_EDGE_MESH).
 *
 * Two (or more) edge nodes form a sibling cache: on a cold local miss a node asks its configured peers
 * over a plaintext ProtoConn::PROTO_MESH link before hitting the origin, and pulls a fresh copy from
 * whichever peer already has it - so the origin is fetched once per fleet, not once per node. The pull
 * carries the object's freshness/age, so a sibling-fresh object is served for its remaining lifetime with
 * zero origin contact. A serving node answers only from its LOCAL cache (one hop - it never re-queries its
 * own origin or peers, so the fleet cannot loop). Pull only: no push, no invalidation.
 *
 * This is the edge-cache example (79) plus three calls: listen(MESH_PORT, PROTO_MESH) opens the
 * sibling port, pc_edge_cache_mesh_serve() answers peers from the local cache, and pc_edge_cache_add_peer()
 * lists a sibling to query on a miss. Flash the SAME sketch to both boards, giving each the OTHER's IP as
 * PEER_IP. Warm node A (request GET /cdn/<path> from A), then request the same URL from node B: B reports
 * X-Cache: MESH and the origin never sees B.
 *
 * NOTE (PlatformIO): the cache is compiled into the *library*, so the flags must reach the whole build:
 * build_flags = -DPC_ENABLE_EDGE_CACHE=1 -DPC_ENABLE_HTTP_CACHE=1 -DPC_ENABLE_HTTP_CLIENT=1
 * -DPC_ENABLE_EDGE_MESH=1. In the Arduino IDE they are set for you in build_opt.h.
 *
 * SIZING: build_opt.h dials the cache down (PC_EDGE_CACHE_SLOTS=2, PC_EDGE_FETCH_SLOTS=1,
 * PC_MESH_MAX_PEERS=1) so the sketch's static BSS fits the classic ESP32's smaller DRAM. On a PSRAM
 * board bump the slots/fetch/peer counts back up (the defaults are 4/2/4) for a warmer, larger cache.
