/**
 * @file dns.h
 * @brief Name resolution, both directions: asking and answering.
 *
 * One module with two halves. The resolver turns a name into an address; the server answers a query
 * with one. They are the same protocol seen from either end, so they sit together and a caller
 * reaches whichever it needs through @ref Dns rather than knowing two modules.
 *
 * Reached as `network.dns->resolver->resolve(...)`. The halves are pointers rather than values
 * because a table in one translation unit is not a constant expression in another, so a by-value
 * member could not be initialized from here.
