/**
 * @file server.h
 * @brief Authoritative DNS server (UDP/53) - resolve local names on an offline LAN.
 *
 * A tiny name server for a network with no path to a real DNS: register `name -> IPv4` A
 * records with @ref DnsServerNs::add and the device answers matching A/IN queries from that fixed
 * table (NXDOMAIN for anything else). Devices can then use `printer.lan` instead of
 * `192.168.1.5`, a companion to the NTP server for self-hosted, offline infrastructure. Zero
 * heap; gated by PROTOCORE_ENABLE_DNS_SERVER.
 *
 * The response builder (@ref DnsServerNs::build_response) is pure - it parses the query and, via a
 * resolver callback, writes the reply - so the wire format is host-tested with no lwIP.
 * @ref DnsServerNs::begin binds UDP/53 through the transport UDP service and serves the built-in
 * table (@ref DnsServerNs::lookup). It is a general resolver, distinct from the provisioning
 * captive-portal DNS (which points every name at the softAP); do not enable both.
