/**
 * @file dns_wire.h
 * @brief The DNS name on the wire (RFC 1035 sec 3.1, sec 4.1.4): labels in, dotted string out.
 *
 * A name is a run of length-prefixed labels ending in a zero byte, and a length byte with its top
 * two bits set is a pointer to a name earlier in the same message instead. Every DNS-shaped protocol
 * carries that encoding, so it is written once here: the unicast server answering a query and the
 * mDNS responder advertising a service read and write names through these.
 *
 * Names compare case-insensitively (sec 2.3.3), which is a property of the encoding rather than of
 * either caller, so the comparison sits here too.
 *
 * Pure: no state, no allocation, no I/O.
