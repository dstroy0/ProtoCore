 * @file forward.h
 * @brief Interface forwarding plane (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_FORWARD) - the v5 bridge / router.
 *
 * A forwarding plane over the ingest pipeline. You register **interfaces** (Wi-Fi STA /
 * AP, Ethernet, a peripheral bus, a radio), each with an egress **send callback**, then
 * add per-pair **rules** (`src -> dst`, allow or deny, with an optional rate cap). When a
 * frame arrives on an interface you call protocore_forward_ingress(); the plane evaluates the
 * rules and forwards the bytes to **every allowed destination** by calling that
 * destination's send callback - so the device bridges / routes between its interfaces
 * instead of only terminating traffic.
 *
 * The canonical wiring is DMA-driven: an inbound DMA-complete event (mmgr/dma) is
 * posted onto the FORWARD lane (services/system/preempt_queue), whose task calls
 * protocore_forward_ingress(), and each destination's send callback hands the bytes to that
 * interface's egress DMA. The plane itself is decoupled from both - it only knows
 * interfaces, rules, and the send callbacks - so it is pure and host-testable.
 *
 * **Default-deny**: a `(src, dst)` pair is forwarded only when an ALLOW rule matches and
 * no DENY rule does (a DENY always wins). A frame is never reflected to its source
 * interface. **Fail-closed**: an exceeded rate cap or a send callback returning false
 * drops the frame for that destination and is counted - it never blocks. Storage is
 * static (zero heap): PROTOCORE_FWD_MAX_RULES rules. The interfaces are layer 1's, over
 * PROTOCORE_PHY_MAX_IFACES rows, and this plane reads that registry rather than keeping its own.
 *
 * **Policy routing** (route-by-tag): a policy route (protocore_forward_route_add) matches a frame by
 * the same byte-pattern primitive as the ACL - so it keys on any field at a known offset
 * (EtherType, IP protocol, a port, an address prefix) - and binds the match to a single
 * **egress interface**. A matched frame is forwarded only to that interface, taking precedence
 * over the src->dst fan-out (first matching route wins); if no policy route matches, the normal
 * rules apply. This is policy-based routing layered on the plane: tagged traffic leaves a chosen
 * NIC / radio. The ingress ACL still runs first, and the same rate-cap / never-reflect /
 * fail-closed guarantees apply to the chosen egress.
 *
 * **Inspection hook** (PROTOCORE_FWD_INSPECT, off by default for cost + privacy): when built in, an
 * app can register an inspector (protocore_forward_set_inspector) that runs on every ingress frame
 * after the ACL and before routing - to observe / parse / meter, and optionally drop it. It is a
 * flexible app callback (arbitrary logic), complementing the fast fixed-offset ACL.
