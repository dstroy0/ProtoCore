/**
 * @file roaming.h
 * @brief Wi-Fi roaming decision layer (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_ROAMING) - the policy that picks a roam target.
 *
 * The three 802.11 roaming primitives are supplicant / hardware territory: 802.11k surfaces a neighbor
 * report (candidate APs), 802.11v delivers a BSS-Transition-Management hint from the network, and 802.11r
 * does the fast transition. This module is the piece between them: the pure, deterministic policy that
 * fuses the current link's RSSI, a candidate neighbor list, and an optional BTM hint into a decision -
 * roam or stay, and to which AP and why. It holds no state and touches no radio, so it is fully
 * host-testable with synthetic inputs; the caller feeds it real data and executes the transition.

/**
 * @brief The roaming module.
 *
 * @var RoamNs::decide
 * Decide whether and where to roam (pure, stateless). Priority order: a disassociation-imminent BTM
 * forces a roam (to the preferred candidate if it is in the list, else the strongest); a non-imminent
 * BTM with a preferred, no-weaker candidate is honoured next; otherwise, when the current RSSI is
 * at/below the policy threshold and the strongest candidate beats it by at least the hysteresis
 * margin, roam to that candidate. The current AP is never chosen as a target. @c current_bssid is the
 * BSSID we are associated with and is excluded from the candidates; @c btm and @c policy may be null
 * (a conservative default policy is used); @c out receives the decision and is never null.
 *
 * @var RoamNs::parse_neighbor_report
 * Parse a sequence of 802.11k Neighbor Report elements into up to @c max candidate APs, returning how
 * many were parsed. @c elems is the element list an 802.11k Neighbor Report Response action frame
 * carries, with the action header already stripped. Each Neighbor Report element (id 52) supplies a
 * candidate's BSSID and operating channel; other element ids are skipped. The report carries no signal
 * strength, so each candidate's @c rssi_dbm comes back as @ref PROTOCORE_ROAM_RSSI_UNKNOWN for the caller to
 * fill before feeding the list to @ref RoamNs::decide.
 *
 * @var RoamNs::parse_btm_request
 * Parse an 802.11v BSS Transition Management Request action frame into a @ref protocore_roam_btm hint, true
 * only for a well-formed request (@c out is cleared otherwise). @c frame starts at the action-frame
 * Category octet (WNM category 0x0A, BTM-Request action 0x07). The Request Mode flags set
 * @c disassoc_imminent (bit 2); when the preferred-candidate-list bit (bit 0) is set, the
 * highest-preference candidate's BSSID becomes @c preferred_bssid, decoded past the optional BSS
 * Termination Duration and Session Information URL.
 *
 * No storage member: the policy is pure and holds nothing between calls.
