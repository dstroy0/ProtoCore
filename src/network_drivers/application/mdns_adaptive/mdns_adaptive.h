 * @file mdns_adaptive.h
 * @brief Adaptive mDNS beacon scheduling: RF-aware backoff, TTL refresher, auto-sleep beacon
 *        (PC_ENABLE_MDNS_ADAPTIVE).
 *
 * The mDNS service (shipped) announces records with a TTL; caches on the network evict a record when its
 * TTL lapses, so a device must re-announce to stay discoverable. Two pressures shape *when* to announce:
 *
 *  - **Crowded RF**: on a busy 2.4 GHz channel, hammering announces just adds collisions. So back the
 *    announce interval off (toward a ceiling) when contention is high, and recover it toward the nominal
 *    cadence when the air is quiet.
 *  - **A continuous refresher**: re-announce at ~half the record TTL (RFC 6762 cache eviction is at TTL)
 *    so caches never lapse in steady state.
 *  - **Auto-sleep beacons**: before entering a sleep window that would run past the next refresh, announce
 *    *now* so the record survives the sleep instead of lapsing while the radio is off.
 *
 * These are the pure scheduling decisions - what interval, and is an announce due (incl. before a sleep).
 * The app owns the actual mDNS transmit. Wrap-safe time math, no heap, no stdlib, host-testable.
