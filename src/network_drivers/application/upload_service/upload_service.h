/**
 * @file upload_service.h
 * @brief Streaming file upload to an Arduino FS (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_UPLOAD).
 *
 * Registers a POST route whose request body is streamed straight into a file on
 * a filesystem (LittleFS / SPIFFS / SD) in FILE_CHUNK_SIZE pieces - the upload
 * never has to fit in RAM. Reuses the parser's streaming-body hook (the same
 * mechanism OTA uses), so it is zero-heap and bounded.
 *
 * One upload at a time (the device runs a single loop task). Only one streaming
 * sink can be installed, so PROTOCORE_ENABLE_UPLOAD and PROTOCORE_ENABLE_OTA share the
 * parser hook - register whichever you need (not both on the same build).

/**
 * @brief Register a streaming-upload endpoint.

 * (the file is truncated/created). The route handler replies `200 OK <n> bytes` on
 * success, or 500 on a write failure or when nothing is mounted.
 *
 * The destination store is whatever protocore_mnt_mount() last mounted, read through
 * protocore_mnt_active() at each request, so an upload follows a hotswap rather than
 * capturing one filesystem at registration time.
