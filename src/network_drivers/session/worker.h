/**
 * @file worker.h
 * @brief Layer 5 (Session) - server worker identity.
 *
 * The server pipeline runs in one or more dedicated worker tasks (see
 * PROTOCORE_WORKER_COUNT). Each worker owns a disjoint partition of connection slots
 * (slot i -> worker i % count) and its own scratch arena, so per-worker state
 * (the arena, work buffers) is selected by the caller's worker id. This header is
 * the single source of that id.
 *
 * The id is per-task/per-thread: a worker binds itself once at task entry via
 * protocore_worker_set_self(); any context that has not bound an id (the user's
 * loop(), a unit test, the lwIP thread) reads 0, which is also the only valid id
 * in the default single-worker build, so PROTOCORE_WORKER_COUNT == 1 is byte-for-byte
 * the original single-pipeline behavior.

// Worker identity (protocore_worker_count / protocore_worker_self / protocore_worker_set_self) is declared in

// On ESP32 the server runs in dedicated FreeRTOS worker tasks instead of the
// user's loop(): protocore_workers_start() spawns PROTOCORE_WORKER_COUNT tasks, each
// pinned to a core, each binding its worker id and repeatedly invoking the
// app-supplied pump (so this layer stays free of any app dependency). On host
// builds there are no tasks - the pipeline is driven inline by handle() / tests -
// so these are no-ops and protocore_workers_running() is false.

//
// HttpRoute a callback to a worker so it runs in that worker's single-thread context.
// This is how application code on loop() (or any other task) safely pushes to a
// connection - e.g. an SSE broadcast on a timer, or ws_send from a sensor task:
// instead of calling the send API directly (which would race the worker that owns
// the slot), wrap it in a small function and hand it to the owning worker. The
// worker drains and runs deferred callbacks each service iteration.
// (defer(slot, fn, arg) is the app-facing wrapper that resolves the
// slot's owner; this layer stays free of the transport/conn_pool dependency.)
//
// @p arg must remain valid until the callback runs (point it at static/global
// state, or data you keep alive). On host builds (no worker task) the callback
// runs inline immediately, so tests and loop()-driven code behave identically.
