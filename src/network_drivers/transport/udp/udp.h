/**
 * @file udp.h
 * @brief Layer 4 (Transport), connectionless: the two sides of UDP, joined.
 *
 * One module with two halves. The listener binds a port, receives on it, and answers from it; the
 * client sends from an ephemeral port and receives nothing. They are the same datagram service seen
 * from either end, so they sit together and a caller reaches whichever it needs through @ref Udp
 * rather than knowing two modules.
 *
 * Both halves own their stack plumbing (`udp_pcb`, `pbuf`) and hand out framed rings instead, so no
 * stack type reaches a layer above this one.
 *
 * Every send here takes a `protocore_ip`, never a name or its text. A caller that starts from either turns
 * it into an address once, where it enters, and keeps that: resolving a name or parsing a string
 * per datagram puts that work on the send path of every call.
 *
 * Each half is reached through its own handle: ::UdpListener and ::UdpClient. The halves are pointers
 * rather than values because a table in one translation unit is not a constant expression in
 * another, so a by-value member could not be initialized from here.
