 * @file net_addr.h
 * @brief Layer 4 (Transport) - the stack's address type, as the library's ::protocore_ip.
 *
 * The stack keeps a peer address in its own family-tagged union, laid out however the vendor chose.
 * Everything above the transport carries a ::protocore_ip: a one-byte family tag and sixteen bytes in
 * network order, the same on every target. TCP needs that mapping on accept and on the per-slot
 * address accessor; UDP needs it once per received datagram. One conversion serves both, so it sits
 * beside them rather than inside either.
 *
 * The address bytes are read out of the vendor value byte by byte rather than shifted out of it. A
 * shift reads the value's arithmetic, which is the host's byte order; the stack holds the address in
 * network order, so the bytes are the address and the number is not.
