 * @file auth.h
 * @brief HTTP authentication: Basic (RFC 7617) and stateless Digest (RFC 7616, SHA-256, qop=auth).
 *
 * Digest carries no per-nonce server state. A nonce is `<issue_ms_hex>.<mac_hex>` where the MAC is
 * SHA-256(secret || issue_ms) truncated to 128 bits, so a returned nonce is authenticated by
 * recomputing it and aged by reading the issue time back out of it. That is what makes the scheme
 * safe under the shared-nothing worker model: the keying secret is set once at begin() and is
 * read-only afterwards, and no worker owns a nonce table another worker has to see.
 *
 * The module exports one symbol, @ref Auth. Everything in auth.c has internal linkage.

/**
 * @brief The authentication module.
 *
 * @var AuthNs::add
 * Record one credential set and return the id that names it, or @ref PC_AUTH_NONE when the table is
 * full. A route stores that id; it never stores the credential, so no route slot carries key
 * material and the same set can serve several routes.
 *
 * @var AuthNs::check
 * True when the request carries credentials matching the set @c id names. Which scheme applies is
 * the set's own property, so the caller does not choose between Basic and Digest.
 *
 * For Basic the decoded credential is split on its first colon and BOTH halves are compared in
 * constant time at their stated lengths - never as strings, because an embedded NUL must not
 * truncate a submitted password into a shorter one that happens to match.
 *
 * For Digest, @c stale comes back true
 * for credentials that verify against a nonce this server minted but whose issue time falls outside
 * the nonce lifetime: that is a reissue, not a rejection, so the caller re-challenges with
 * `stale=true` and the client retries without prompting the user again (RFC 7616 3.3). It is left
 * untouched on a credential mismatch or a forged nonce, where the only correct answer is no.
 *
 * @var AuthNs::challenge
 * Write the 401 and its `WWW-Authenticate` header for the set @c id names, Basic or Digest as that
 * set says. @c stale marks the transparent-retry case above.
 *
 * @var AuthNs::rekey
 * (Re)seed the Digest keying secret from the CSPRNG. Runs once per begin(); every nonce the server
 * mints afterwards is keyed by it, and it never leaves this module.
 *
 * @var AuthNs::mint_nonce
 * Mint a fresh nonce into @c out, which needs a capacity of at least 48.
 *
 * @var AuthNs::verify_nonce
 * True when @c nonce carries a MAC this server could have produced. @c expired is set when the MAC
 * is authentic but the issue time falls outside the nonce lifetime - authentic and fresh are
 * separate answers, and only the pair of them justifies trusting the credential that arrived with it.
 *
 * @var AuthNs::reset
 * Empty the credential table. An id names a row by index and a route holds that id, so the table
 * empties with the routes it is indexed from: pc_server_reset() calls both. A table that kept its
 * rows across a reset would reach @ref PC_AUTH_NONE after MAX_ROUTES registrations and hand every
 * later route an id that guards nothing.
 *
 * The keying secret is the module's own storage and is not a member: it is written at
 * @ref AuthNs::rekey and read by nothing outside auth.c, so exposing a handle to it would widen the
 * surface without giving any caller something it can use.
