/**
 * @file pc_quic_server.h
 * @brief HTTP/3 server glue - binds UDP to a pool of QUIC + HTTP/3 connections (RFC 9000/9114).
 *
 * The last piece of the HTTP/3 stack: it owns a fixed pool of QuicConn + H3Conn engines, binds the
 * HTTP/3 UDP port through the transport layer (pc_udp), routes each inbound datagram to the right
 * connection by its Destination Connection ID (a new client Initial opens a pool slot), drives the
 * handshake + streams, and pulls the outbound datagrams back onto the wire. A completed HTTP/3
 * request is surfaced through a single callback; the application answers with pc_quic_server_respond().
 *
 * Threading (ESP32): pc_udp delivers datagrams on the lwIP thread, but requests must be dispatched
 * on the server's worker/main loop, so the UDP handler only copies each datagram into a lock-free
 * ingest ring; pc_quic_server_poll() (called from the loop) drains the ring, runs the engines, and
 * sends replies. The engines therefore only ever run in one context.
 *
 * The pool (QuicConn + H3Conn per slot + the ingest ring) is large, so like HTTP/2 it is a
 * PSRAM-class feature. No heap; fixed storage. This module has no PC dependency - the
 * request/response seam is a plain callback - so the route-dispatch bridge lives in the server.
