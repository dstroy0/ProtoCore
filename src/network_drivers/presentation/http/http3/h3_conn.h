/**
 * @file pc_h3_conn.h
 * @brief HTTP/3 application engine over QUIC streams (RFC 9114).
 *
 * Sits on top of the QUIC transport engine (pc_quic_conn) and speaks HTTP/3: on the handshake
 * completing it opens the server's unidirectional control stream (sending SETTINGS) and the two
 * QPACK encoder / decoder streams, reads the client's control stream, and on each client-initiated
 * bidirectional request stream reassembles the HTTP/3 frames - QPACK-decoding the HEADERS field
 * section into a request (method / path / authority + a small header set) and collecting the DATA
 * body - then hands the finished request to the application through a callback. pc_h3_conn_respond()
 * serializes a response (HEADERS + DATA) back onto the request stream and finishes it.
 *
 * QPACK is static-table only (we advertise QPACK_MAX_TABLE_CAPACITY = 0), so no dynamic-table state
 * is needed and the encoder / decoder streams carry only their stream-type byte. Fixed storage, no
 * heap; host-testable by feeding it decoded stream bytes through the pc_quic_conn callback seam.
