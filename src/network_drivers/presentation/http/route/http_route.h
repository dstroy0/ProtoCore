 * @brief The route table: where a request goes.
 *
 * A row names a path pattern, a method, a handler, and the ws / sse / mount / credential id the
 * request needs. Every one of those is HTTP, so the table sits under the HTTP root rather than at
 * the network layer, which routes datagrams.
 *
 * The module exports one symbol, @ref HttpRoutes. Everything in route.c has internal linkage.
