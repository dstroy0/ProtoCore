/**
 * @file protocore_h2_conn.h
 * @brief HTTP/2 connection + stream engine (RFC 9113) over the HPACK + frame layers.
 *
 * One H2Conn drives a single HTTP/2 connection: it consumes the client connection preface, the
 * SETTINGS exchange, and the frame stream; reassembles each request's header block (HEADERS +
 * CONTINUATION) and HPACK-decodes it; tracks per-stream state and connection / stream flow
 * control; and answers control frames (SETTINGS ACK, PING ACK, WINDOW_UPDATE). Decoded requests
 * and body data are handed to the application through callbacks, and protocore_h2_conn_respond() serializes
 * a response as HEADERS + DATA frames. Outbound bytes go through a caller-supplied writer, so the
 * engine has no transport dependency and is host-testable by feeding it a byte stream.
 *
 * Fixed storage, no heap: one frame-reassembly buffer, one header-block buffer, an HPACK decoder
 * table, and a small stream table per connection (sizes from PROTOCORE_H2_*).
