/**
 * @file pc_h2_server.h
 * @brief Bridge between the HTTP/2 engine (pc_h2_conn) and the server's request pipeline.
 *
 * When a TLS connection negotiates ALPN "h2", the session layer hands its decrypted bytes to
 * this module instead of the HTTP/1.1 parser. It runs one pc_h2_conn per connection slot, maps each
 * decoded request's pseudo-headers (:method / :path / :authority) and headers into the slot's
 * HttpReq, and marks it PARSE_COMPLETE so the existing route dispatcher serves it. Responses from
 * the handlers route back here (send branches on the slot's h2 flag) and are
 * serialized as HEADERS + DATA frames, leaving the connection open for the next stream.
 *
 * The per-slot engines are large (a whole frame is buffered), so their pool lives in PSRAM where
 * available; HTTP/2 is therefore practical on PSRAM boards (ESP32-S3/-P4, WROVER).
