 * @brief Layer 6 (Presentation) - zero-heap CBOR (RFC 8949) encoder.
 *
 * A streaming encoder that writes directly into a caller-provided buffer (no
 * heap), the binary counterpart to the JSON writer. Emit definite-length arrays
 * and maps by writing the header (Cbor.put_array / Cbor.put_map with the item count) then
 * that many items (twice that for a map: key, value, key, value, ...).
 *
 * Overflow is tracked, not crashed on: writes past the buffer set the overflow
 * flag and stop, while pc_span_len() keeps counting the bytes the full payload would
 * need, so a caller can size the buffer and check pc_span_ok().
