 * @file msgpack.h
 * @brief Layer 6 (Presentation) - zero-heap MessagePack encoder and decoder.
 *
 * A streaming encoder that writes directly into a caller-provided buffer (no
 * heap), the MessagePack-format sibling of the CBOR / JSON writers. Each value is
 * emitted in the shortest MessagePack form (fixint / fixstr / fixarray / fixmap
 * where possible). Emit definite-length arrays and maps by writing the header
 * (MsgPack.put_array / MsgPack.put_map with the item count) then that many items (twice
 * that for a map: key, value, key, value, ...).
 *
 * Overflow is tracked, not crashed on: writes past the buffer set the span's overflow
 * flag and stop, while pc_span_len() keeps counting the bytes the full payload
 * would need, so a caller can size the buffer and check pc_span_ok().
 *
 * The decoder is a cursor: MsgPack.peek() reports the next object's type and the
 * MsgPack.get_* calls consume it (strings and binary point into the source buffer,
 * no copy). Any malformed or out-of-bounds read sets a sticky error - check
 * pc_cspan_ok(). ext and the unused 0xc1 byte are reported as INVALID.
