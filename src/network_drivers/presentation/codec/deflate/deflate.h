/**
 * @file deflate.h
 * @brief Bounded RFC 1951 DEFLATE compressor (DEFLATE) - no heap.
 *
 * The outbound counterpart to inflate.* : a small, host-testable DEFLATE used by
 * WebSocket permessage-deflate (RFC 7692) to compress server-to-client messages.
 * It emits a single fixed-Huffman block (no dynamic tables to build) with LZ77
 * back-references found over a bounded sliding window, then byte-aligns with an
 * empty stored block and removes the trailing 0x00 0x00 0xff 0xff per
 * RFC 7692 sec 7.2.1 - so the result is a ready-to-frame permessage-deflate
 * payload. The peer's INFLATE re-appends that marker before decompressing (our
 * own RX path does exactly that, see websocket.cpp).
 *
 * Matching reads from the source buffer itself - there is no kept window across
 * messages, which is correct for `no_context_takeover` (the mode the handshake
 * negotiates) and bounds memory: distances never exceed DEFLATE_WINDOW and the
 * only working memory is a caller-supplied scratch (DEFLATE_SCRATCH_SIZE bytes,
 * borrowed from the per-dispatch arena, like inflate).
 *
 * Fixed (not dynamic) Huffman keeps the encoder tiny and deterministic; it never
 * builds an optimal tree, so the ratio is modest, but for the small JSON/text
 * frames this serves it still shrinks the wire while costing no dedicated buffer.
 * If the output would not be smaller than the input the caller simply sends the
 * message uncompressed (the per-message RSV1 flag makes that legal).
