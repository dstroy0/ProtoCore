 * @file ssh_zlib.h
 * @brief SSH server-to-client compression: a context-takeover DEFLATE stream (no heap).
 *
 * SSH `zlib` / `zlib@openssh.com` (RFC 4253 sec 6.2) compress the packet payload with a single zlib
 * stream per direction that is kept alive for the whole session - a persistent sliding window carried
 * across packets ("context takeover"), sync-flushed at each packet boundary. This is the OPPOSITE of
 * the WebSocket permessage-deflate codec (presentation/deflate), which is stateless per message
 * (`no_context_takeover`); the two cannot share an instance.
 *
 * This file is the SERVER->CLIENT (deflate) half. It emits a zlib stream (RFC 1950 2-byte header once,
 * then RFC 1951 fixed-Huffman blocks) with a Z_SYNC_FLUSH boundary after every packet: the block is
 * byte-aligned and the empty stored block `00 00 ff ff` is KEPT on the wire (unlike permessage-deflate,
 * which strips it). A standard zlib `inflate()` - as in OpenSSH - decodes it. The CLIENT->SERVER
 * (inflate) half lives in ssh_inflate.h: OpenSSH compresses its outbound with Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, so that
 * side is a resumable, context-takeover inflate carrying bit state + the window across packets.
 *
 * All state and buffers are caller-supplied; the codec allocates nothing. See ssh_zlib.c for the
 * work-buffer / hash-table sizing helpers (SSH_ZLIB_* macros).
