 * @file ssh_client.h
 * @brief Outbound SSH client + reverse tunnel (PC_ENABLE_SSH_CLIENT).
 *
 * The SSH server terminates inbound connections; this is the mirror - the device is the SSH
 * *client*, dialing OUT to a relay and asking it to forward a port back. That is how a device behind
 * NAT / a firewall stays reachable: it holds a `tcpip-forward` (RFC 4254 §7.1, the `ssh -R` seam) to
 * a relay with a public address, and a connection to the relay's forwarded port is tunnelled back to
 * a service on the device - the standards-track "secure machine bridge over untrusted networks".
 *
 * ── What it negotiates ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   kex     : mlkem768x25519-sha256 (PQ/T hybrid, PC_ENABLE_PQC_KEX), curve25519-sha256,
 *             ecdh-sha2-nistp256, diffie-hellman-group14-sha256
 *   hostkey : ssh-ed25519, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, rsa-sha2-512, rsa-sha2-256 - verified against a pin
 *   cipher  : chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com, aes256-gcm@openssh.com, aes256-ctr (+ hmac-sha2-256/512,
 *             ETM and E&M)
 *   auth    : publickey, ssh-ed25519 (RFC 4252 §7) - the device signs with its own key
 *
 * The client offers the full suite and negotiates whatever the relay supports (RFC 4253 §7.1 order),
 * so it interoperates with any modern SSH server without being kneecapped to one algorithm. It reuses
 * the transport primitives the server already ships (the curve/DH/ECDH KEX cores, ML-KEM-768, ed25519
 * / ECDSA / RSA verify, chacha-poly / AES-GCM / AES-CTR, the RFC 4253 §7.2 KDF, and the role-aware
 * binary packet layer), so this file is the client-role state machine only, not a second crypto stack.
 *
 * ── Security ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The relay's host key is **pinned** by fingerprint: the caller supplies the SHA-256 of the expected
 * host-key blob (K_S), and the handshake aborts if the relay presents anything else (no
 * trust-on-first-use, no accepting an unknown key). Pinning the fingerprint rather than a raw key is
 * host-key-type agnostic - it works whether the relay's key is ed25519, ECDSA or RSA. The device
 * authenticates with an ssh-ed25519 key of its own, whose public half the relay carries in
 * `authorized_keys`.
