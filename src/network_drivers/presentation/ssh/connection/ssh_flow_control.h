 * @file ssh_flow_control.h
 * @brief SSH channel flow control - the RFC 4254 sec 5.2 window pair and nothing else.
 *
 * Every channel carries two independent counters: how many bytes the peer may still send us before
 * we replenish (local), and how many we may still send it (peer). Getting either wrong desynchronizes
 * the session - overrun the peer's window and it drops the channel, forget to replenish ours and the
 * transfer stalls forever with both sides waiting.
 *
 * The accounting lived in four places before this file existed: ssh_channel.cpp held the counters and
 * the rules, ssh_forward.cpp read `peer_window` directly to size its reads, ssh_server.cpp routed the
 * adjust message, and ssh_client.cpp carried a second implementation of the same arithmetic. One
 * concern, one owner: the counters are only correct if a single piece of code decides what they mean.
 *
 * Channel multiplexing stays in ssh_channel.* - this file knows nothing about channel ids, types, or
 * the pool. It is the arithmetic and the rules, over one channel's pair of counters.
