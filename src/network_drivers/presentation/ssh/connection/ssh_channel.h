 * @file ssh_channel.h
 * @brief SSH connection protocol - multiplexed "session" channels (RFC 4254).
 *
 * After authentication the client opens one or more channels; this layer confirms
 * each, accepts a shell/exec/pty request, and exchanges SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_DATA.
 * Inbound channel data is surfaced to the application as a raw byte stream (no PTY
 * emulation), tagged with its channel id; outbound data is framed back to the
 * client on a given channel. Flow control follows RFC 4254 §5.2 (per-channel
 * window tracking + WINDOW_ADJUST).
 *
 * Up to PC_SSH_MAX_CHANNELS channels per connection are multiplexed, each with
 * its own id, peer id, and windows. The default (1) is the original single-channel
 * control/console link. Every inbound message is routed to its channel by the
 * recipient channel id it carries.
