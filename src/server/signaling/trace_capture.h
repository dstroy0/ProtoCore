/**
 * @file trace_capture.h
 * @brief Pre/post-trigger sample-window assembler (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_TRACE_CAPTURE) - the v5
 *        high-rate acquisition primitive.
 *
 * The consumer sitting downstream of mmgr/dma on a sampling front end (an external
 * ADC front-end - e.g. an AD9226/AD9238 - draining into the device over SPI or UART DMA,
 * a benchtop scope's digitizer output, or any other high-rate source): protocore_tc_feed()
 * is called with every batch of samples as they arrive (from a DMA-complete handler, most
 * naturally), and a continuously-running **pre-trigger ring** always holds the most recent
 * @ref protocore_tc_config::pretrigger_samples samples. When protocore_tc_trigger() fires - a GPIO ISR,
 * a software threshold detector, or an external front-end's own trigger line - the ring's
 * current content becomes the pre-trigger half of the window and subsequent feeds fill the
 * post-trigger half, so the emitted window straddles the trigger instant exactly like a
 * benchtop oscilloscope's pretrigger/posttrigger split, even though the trigger is detected
 * only after the pre-trigger samples already went by.
 *
 * One capture in flight at a time, fail-closed: a trigger while a window is still filling is
 * rejected and counted (@ref protocore_tc_stats::triggers_dropped), never queued or stomped - the
 * same determinism contract as mmgr/dma's one-TX-in-flight rule. Storage is static
 * (PROTOCORE_TC_MAX_WINDOW_SAMPLES samples, zero heap); feed() and trigger() are ISR-safe (no
 * blocking, no allocation) so the natural wiring is a DMA-complete callback calling feed()
 * and a GPIO ISR calling trigger(), both posting nothing further themselves - the window
 * callback fires inline the instant the post-trigger half completes.
 *
 * Window-assembly latency (trigger() to the completed callback) is timestamped with
 * protocore_cycles() (server/clock/clock.h) rather than protocore_micros(): at the sample rates this feeds
 * from (an SPI-drained ADC burst can complete several feed() calls within a single
 * microsecond tick) a 1 us clock under-resolves the jitter that matters for sizing
 * PROTOCORE_DMA_BUF_SIZE / the post-trigger sample count; protocore_cycles_to_ns() converts the
 * measured cycle delta to nanoseconds once the caller supplies the running CPU frequency.
