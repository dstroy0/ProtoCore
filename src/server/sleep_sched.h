/**
 * @file sleep_sched.h
 * @brief Dynamic sleep-cycle scheduler (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_SLEEP_SCHED).
 *
 * Decides, from the time since the last activity, whether a low-power device should sleep between
 * requests and for how long - so a battery / solar node idles most of the time yet still serves. It is
 * a pure decision core (`protocore_sleep_next`): given `now`, the last-activity timestamp, and a config, it
 * returns the number of milliseconds to sleep (0 = stay awake). The device stays awake until it has
 * been idle for `idle_ms`, then sleeps in windows that ramp from `min_ms` up to `max_ms` the longer the
 * idle streak runs (so a briefly-idle device wakes often and responsively, a long-idle one sleeps deep).
 *
 * Pure, zero heap, no stdlib, and takes an explicit `now`, so it is fully host-testable with a synthetic
 * clock. The scheduler only decides the window; the app applies it per its own policy (an
 * `esp_light_sleep_start()` with a timer wakeup, modem sleep, or deep sleep). It sits beside
 * network_drivers/physical/radio_power (modem sleep): that trims radio power while awake, this schedules the sleep.
