/**
 * @file edge_cache_sd.h
 * @brief CDN edge-cache tier - L2 SD persistence (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_EDGE_CACHE && PROTOCORE_ENABLE_DBM).
 *
 * The persistent second tier behind the bounded L1 RAM store (edge_cache): an evicted L1 entry is
 * written back to a dbm key-value store on the WAL (services/storage/dbm, SD-card backed on device, a RAM WalDev
 * for host tests), and an L1 miss is served by promoting the entry back from L2. Because the store is
 * log-structured on the WAL, the cached set survives a reboot (dbm rebuilds its index by replaying the
 * log on open).
 *
 * The L2 key is the entry's 32-byte SHA-256 digest (== PROTOCORE_DBM_KEY_MAX), so no key is re-derived. The
 * value is a compact, versioned, little-endian serialization of the entry's response metadata + body.
 *
 * These are pure functions over a caller-owned dbm handle and a caller-owned scratch buffer (no
 * file-scope state); the proxy glue (edge_cache_proxy) owns the dbm and the buffer and installs the
 * write-back / promote wiring.
 *
 * Reboot note: the monotonic insert time is meaningless across a reboot (no wall clock), so a promoted
 * entry is always treated as stale by the caller and revalidated - which is why only entries carrying a
 * validator (ETag / Last-Modified) are spilled: they are exactly the ones a cheap 304 can refresh.
