 * @file filesystem.h
 * @brief The filesystem accessor: it owns the mount root, it owns the resolved path, and it is the
 *        only way a request reaches storage.
 *
 * A wire protocol (SFTP, SCP, WebDAV) knows a *request* path - the bytes a client sent. It does not
 * know where the mount lives, and it must not be able to escape it. So it never builds a path and
 * never holds one: it hands the request path to an operation here, and this file joins it onto the
 * root, rejects `..`, and dispatches to the mounted backend (mnt.h, alongside this file).
 *
 * That is why the operations take a request path rather than returning one. An accessor that
 * returned a resolved string would put a path buffer, its capacity, and its overflow check into
 * every caller - which is exactly the duplication that had nine identical `char disk[]` arrays and
 * two copies of the `..` guard spread across the SFTP and SCP servers. There is one buffer here,
 * and callers do not size it, see it, or carry it.
 *
 * protocore_fs_path() is the single exception, for the one caller that genuinely needs the text: SFTP
 * REALPATH answers with a path string. It hands back a pointer into this file's storage, or
 * nullptr when it cannot - there is no out/capacity pair to get wrong.
 *
 * The `..` guard is a rejection, not realpath/symlink resolution: the on-flash filesystems
 * (FAT / LittleFS) have no symlinks, so a `..`-free joined path cannot leave the root.
