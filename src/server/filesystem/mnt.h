 * @file mnt.h
 * @brief The mount: which store is behind the filesystem, and the vtable it answers through
 *        (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_MNT).
 *
 * This file answers one question - *what is mounted* - and nothing else. The operations a caller
 * performs live on the filesystem accessor (server/filesystem.h), which resolves a request path
 * against its root and then dispatches here. Splitting it that way means a backend author
 * implements storage and never touches path policy, and the `..` guard cannot be bypassed by
 * reaching a backend directly.
 *
 * Two backends ship:
 *
 *  - **RAM** (built-in, host-testable, zero-heap): a fixed pool of PROTOCORE_MNT_RAM_FILES files of up to
 *    PROTOCORE_MNT_RAM_FILE_SIZE bytes each, all in BSS - deterministic, bounded, and identical on host
 *    and target. It is what lets the SFTP/SCP/WebDAV servers run under a native test.
 *
 *  - **Board filesystem** (board layer): wraps the framework's own file object for persistent
 *    storage. It lives in core_setup/ because it speaks a vendor framework, which the core does
 *    not.
 *
 * Handles are small ints the backend assigns, and a directory cursor is one of them - so ::close
 * releases either kind and there is no second lifetime to get wrong. Every entry point fails
 * closed (-1 / false) when nothing is mounted.
 *
 * Single-accessor like the other services: use it from one context (a worker / loop), not
 * concurrently.

 * one NAME response must hold, WebDAV from an href, the RAM backend from its own file table. Each
 * translation unit derives the length it needs and passes a buffer, so this type stays the four
 * facts and carries no policy.
 *
 * Stat and readdir share it because they answer the same question about the same directory record
 * - asking a backend for a size, then whether it is a directory, then its mtime is three lookups
 * of one record, which on FAT is three seeks to learn what the first read already had.
