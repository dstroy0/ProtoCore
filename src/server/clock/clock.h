 * @file clock.h
 * @brief Pluggable monotonic clock for all library timing.
 *
 * The library's internal timing runs at **1000 Hz** - one tick is one millisecond,
 * the cadence the test suite asserts and every timeout / poll is expressed in.
 * `pc_millis()` is that single time source; by default it is the platform
 * `millis()`.
 *
 * To drive the library from your own clock (a hardware timer, an external RTC, a
 * simulation clock), call:
 *
 *     pc_set_clock(my_clock_fn, my_ticks_per_second);
 *
 * Your clock reports a free-running tick count at `ticks_per_second`. The library
 * **divides it down to its internal 1000 Hz**, so timeouts and polling keep the
 * exact 1 ms granularity the tests verify regardless of how fast your clock runs.
 * Pass a rate >= 1000, ideally a multiple of 1000 for exact division (e.g. a
 * 1 MHz timer -> ticks_per_second = 1000000, divided by 1000). Pass `NULL` to
 * revert to the platform default. One source covers everything - swap it once and
 * every subsystem follows.
 *
 * The worker poll cadence is fixed at 1000 Hz (the tested default); a build can
 * trade latency for idle power with PC_WORKER_POLL_TICKS - see protocore_config.h.
 *
 * The installed clocks live in clock.c, one instance for the whole program, so a
 * build that reads the clock links that translation unit.
