 * @file netadapt.h
 * @brief Network adaptation decisions: TCP window sizing by free RAM + DHCP->static fallback
 *        (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_NETADAPT).
 *
 * Two pure decisions a network manager needs on a memory-constrained, sometimes-headless device:
 *
 *  - `protocore_netadapt_window()` - size the TCP receive window / RX buffer from the free heap, so a device
 *    with RAM to spare uses a bigger window for throughput while a low-memory one shrinks to stay alive.
 *    Keeps a reserve untouched and clamps to a sane [min, max].
 *
 *  - `protocore_netadapt_dhcp_fallback()` - decide when to stop waiting on DHCP and configure a static IP, so
 *    a node on a network with no DHCP server still comes up. Triggers once the elapsed wait exceeds the
 *    timeout or the retry budget is spent.
 *
 * Pure, zero heap, no stdlib, host-testable; the app applies the results (lwIP window / netif config).
