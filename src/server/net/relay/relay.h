/**
 * @file relay.h
 * @brief TCP relay / DNAT port forwarding (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_RELAY) - a bidirectional byte pump.
 *
 * Publishes an internal `host:port` through the server: an inbound (accepted) connection is relayed
 * to an origin (an outbound connection to the internal service), moving bytes in both directions.
 * The engine is pure - it touches the two sockets only through send/recv seams - so it is
 * host-testable and rides `protocore_client` on the device. The app drives it: each poll tick (or whenever
 * a socket is readable/writable) it calls protocore_relay_step() until the relay reports DONE, then closes
 * both sockets.
 *
 * Correctness details:
 *  - **Backpressure**: a `send` seam may accept fewer bytes than offered; the un-accepted bytes are
 *    carried in a per-direction buffer and retried on the next step before more are read.
 *  - **Independent half-close**: each direction finishes when its source signals EOF and its buffer
 *    drains. When a direction finishes, the opposite peer's optional `shutdown` seam is called once
 *    (propagating the half-close so the origin sees the client's FIN); the relay is DONE only when
 *    both directions have finished.
