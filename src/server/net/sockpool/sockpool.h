/**
 * @file sockpool.h
 * @brief Dynamic socket recycling: an LRU connection-slot pool (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_SOCKPOOL).
 *
 * A device serves a bounded number of concurrent connections. When the pool saturates, the right move is
 * not to drop the new connection but to *recycle* the least-recently-active slot (the one most likely to
 * be a dead / idle keep-alive) and hand it to the new peer, returning the evicted id so the transport can
 * close it cleanly. This is the transport-pool half left open by `services/netadapt`.
 *
 * This is that pure policy: a fixed table of connection slots (each an id + last-used tick), with acquire
 * (free slot, else LRU-recycle), touch (mark active), release, and find. The app owns the real sockets;
 * this owns *which* slot a connection lives in and which to reclaim under pressure. No heap, no stdlib,
 * host-testable.
