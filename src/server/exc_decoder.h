 * @file exc_decoder.h
 * @brief ESP32 panic / exception decoder for a live diagnostics panel (PC_ENABLE_EXC_DECODER).
 *
 * When an ESP32 panics it prints a Guru Meditation dump: a cause ("LoadProhibited"), a per-core register
 * dump (PC, EXCVADDR, ...), and a backtrace of `PC:SP` frame pairs. To resolve those PCs to file:line an
 * addr2line-style panel needs the firmware ELF, which lives off-device - so the on-device job is to
 * *extract and present* the raw decode: the cause, the faulting PC + data address, and the ordered
 * backtrace PC list, served as JSON for a live "/exception" panel (the browser or a build server then
 * resolves symbols). This is that extractor.
 *
 * It parses the panic text an app captures (from the console, a saved crash line, or a text rendering of
 * the core-dump partition) into a structured ExcInfo, and serializes it. Pure, zero heap, no stdlib
 * (hand-rolled hex/decimal parsing), host-testable against a captured panic string.

 *  - **Xtensa** (ESP32 / S2 / S3): a real backtrace is recorded on-device, so `frames` is populated
 *    (pc only; sp is not part of the summary) along with the exception cause and faulting address.
 *  - **RISC-V** (C3 / C6 / H2 / P4): the summary carries a stack dump, not a backtrace - resolving
 *    it needs DWARF off-device. `frame_count` is therefore 0 and only the faulting PC and the
 *    machine trap cause / value are filled. Offload the image (pc_exc_coredump_save) and resolve it
