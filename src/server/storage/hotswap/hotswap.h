 * @file hotswap.h
 * @brief Safeties for removable storage that can vanish mid-write (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_HOTSWAP).
 *
 * An SD card is a connector, and a connector can be pulled - during a log append, an upload, a
 * core-dump save. The failure is nasty because it is quiet: the driver keeps handing back a mounted
 * volume, every write reports an error nobody checks, and the code carries on believing it has
 * storage. What should happen instead is that the medium is declared unusable, stale handles are
 * dropped, and callers are told to stop rather than write into nothing.
 *
 * That is what this owns. One state machine per volume:
 *
 *     ABSENT  --probe finds a card, mount succeeds-->  READY
 *     READY   --fail_threshold consecutive I/O errors-->  FAULTED  (unmount fires immediately)
 *     FAULTED --probe interval elapses, remount succeeds-->  READY
 *
 * The threshold matters: a single failed write is not proof a card left (a transient bus error, a
 * full volume), so one error does not tear down a working volume. A run of them is proof enough.
 * Any success resets the run, so intermittent noise never accumulates into a false removal.
 *
 * Callers gate on `protocore_hotswap_ready()` and report every filesystem outcome through
 * `protocore_hotswap_io()`. It is deliberately **fail-closed**: while not READY, ready() is false, so a
 * caller that honors it writes nothing rather than writing into a stale mount.
 *
 * The core is pure and takes an explicit `now`, so the whole state machine is host-testable with a
 * synthetic clock; the device binding is three app callbacks (mount / unmount / optional
 * card-detect), because how a volume is mounted is the application's business, not this owner's.
