/**
 * @file smbus.h
 * @brief SMBus 3.1 transaction shapes over the shared I2C bus.
 *
 * SMBus is I2C with the transaction shapes named and a checksum defined. A part that speaks it
 * (a battery gauge, a fan controller, a power sequencer, a temperature sensor) answers a fixed
 * set of forms rather than whatever register layout its datasheet invents, so one driver reaches
 * all of them: quick command, send / receive byte, write / read byte and word, block write and
 * read, and the two process calls.
 *
 * The Packet Error Code is a CRC-8 over every byte of the transaction, the address bytes and
 * their R/W bits included. It is the catalogue's CRC-8/SMBUS, so it comes from the shared engine
 * (::PROTOCORE_CRC8_SMBUS in shared/crc/crc.h) rather than a loop written here. Turn it on with
 * ::protocore_smbus_set_pec; a part that does not implement PEC NACKs the extra byte.
 *
 * The PEC computation is pure and host-tested. The transfers are I2C, so a build with no bus seam
 * refuses them.
