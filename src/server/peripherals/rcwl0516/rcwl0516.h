/**
 * @file rcwl0516.h
 * @brief RCWL-0516 microwave Doppler presence sensor, and the shared one-GPIO presence facade
 *        (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_RCWL0516).
 *
 * The RCWL-0516 (RCWL-9196 controller + MMBR941M RF amp, ~3.18 GHz Doppler) has no data protocol at
 * all: a single 3.3 V **OUT** pin that latches HIGH when a moving reflector is detected and returns
 * LOW once its own retrigger window expires. Everything interesting is therefore in *time*, not in
 * bytes - which is what this module provides.
 *
 * Two problems a bare `digitalRead()` does not solve, and this does:
 *
 *   1. **Chatter.** The OUT pin is driven by an analog comparator, so around the detection threshold
 *      it can flicker. A raw read turns one person walking past into a burst of presence events.
 *      A level must therefore hold for @ref PresenceCore::debounce_ms before it is believed.
 *
 *   2. **Gaps.** The module drops OUT between retriggers, so a person who is present but briefly
 *      still reads as absent for a moment. Presence is therefore held for
 *      @ref PresenceCore::hold_ms past the last believed-HIGH sample, which turns a stream of
 *      retriggers into one continuous "occupied" span instead of a flapping boolean.
 *
 * The core is pure and takes an explicit @p now, exactly like `services/hotswap`: it decides, the
 * binding acts. That makes the whole machine host-testable by injecting pin levels against a
 * synthetic clock, with no GPIO and no real time involved. All timing comparisons are unsigned
 * differences, so they are wrap-safe across a `millis()` rollover.
 *
 * @ref PresenceCore is deliberately sensor-agnostic: it is a debounced, hold-extended view of one
 * active-high presence pin. The RCWL-0516 is simply its first user, via the
 * @ref protocore_rcwl0516_core_init defaults - the HMMD's OUT pin, a PIR, or an HB100 can reuse the same
 * core by supplying their own two constants.
 *
 * Fail-safe start: a freshly initialized core reports *absent* and treats the pin as idle, so
 * presence is only ever reported after it has actually been observed and believed. Claiming
 * presence you have not yet measured is the failure mode worth avoiding.
