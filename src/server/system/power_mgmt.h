 * @file power_mgmt.h
 * @brief SoC power governor: frequency scaling, thermal throttle, brownout recovery, gating
 *        (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_POWER_MGMT).
 *
 * network_drivers/physical/radio_power owns the radio and server/sleep_sched decides how *long* to sleep. Neither
 * owns the SoC itself, which is where the rest of the power budget goes: the CPU clock, the die
 * temperature, and the peripherals nobody is using.
 *
 * The governor answers one question - given the current load, die temperature, and how the board
 * last reset, what should the CPU clock be right now:
 *
 *  - **Scaling.** Busy work runs at the ceiling; an idle server drops to the floor. Running a
 *    240 MHz core to poll an idle socket is the single easiest power win on this part.
 *  - **Thermal throttle.** Hot parts clock down, and the restore threshold is *lower* than the
 *    throttle threshold. Without that gap a device sitting exactly at the limit oscillates between
 *    full speed and floor forever, which is worse than either.
 *  - **Brownout recovery.** A board that just browned out is on a supply that could not hold up the
 *    last load it saw, so slamming straight back to full speed invites the same collapse and a boot
 *    loop. After a brownout reset it comes up at the floor and stays there for a settle window.
 *  - **Gating.** Blocks the firmware never uses still burn current; Bluetooth is the big one, since
 *    the controller draws power whether or not anything is connected.
 *
 * The decision is pure and takes every input explicitly - load, temperature, the brownout flag, the
 * time since boot, and the previous throttle state for the hysteresis - so the whole governor is
 * host-testable with no hardware. The binding only reads the sensors and applies the result.
