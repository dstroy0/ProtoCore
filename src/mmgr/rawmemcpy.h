/**
 * @file rawmemcpy.h
 * @brief The raw load: bytes at a pointer read as a wider type, in the machine's own order.
 *
 * One owner for the operation every word-at-a-time reader needs - the lane math (swar.h), the
 * span walks (protomem.c), the builder's float bit reads (membuild.h) - so the alignment rule is
 * stated once and every reader inherits it.
 *
 * **The two attributes are the whole implementation.** A bare `*(const uint32_t *)p` says the wrong
 * thing twice, and each attribute answers one of them: `aligned(1)` states that the address carries
 * no alignment guarantee, and `may_alias` states that this type may alias any other.
 *
 * **Machine order, not wire order.** These reconstruct the value the way this machine stores it,
 * which is what reading a representation means. A defined byte order on the wire is a different
 * question and belongs to mmgr/endian.h.
 *
 * These are the primitives the span walks are built from. A caller that wants to move a span asks
 * @ref mem for it.
