 * @file plaintext.c
 * @brief Plaintext pool accessor - implementation.
 *
 * This file is an access layer, not a second allocator. The pool mechanism is ::pc_arena
 * (mmgr/arena) and there is exactly one of it; this module owns one instance per worker slot over
 * compile-time-sized storage and decides who may reach it. The secret pool is the same mechanism
 * instantiated again behind its own accessor - identical resource, identical mechanics, different
 * access and control.
 *
 * Each instance has exactly one accessor (its worker), so the lock-free guarantees in plaintext.h hold
 * per slot. With PC_WORKER_COUNT == 1 this is byte-for-byte the original single arena.
