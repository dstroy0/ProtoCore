 * @file swar.h
 * @brief Lane math: one machine word treated as its byte lanes, tested in parallel.
 *
 * SWAR is "SIMD within a register" - a plain word holds several bytes, and an arithmetic trick
 * answers a question about all of them at once. The trick is the guard bit: set every lane's high
 * bit before subtracting so a borrow cannot cross out of its lane, then read the high bits back as
 * the per-lane answer. What would be one compare and one branch per byte becomes two arithmetic
 * operations and no branches at all.
 *
 * **The width is a typedef, not a decision.** The algebra is identical at any width - the lane masks
 * are derived from ::protocore_swar_word rather than written out, so the carrier follows ::PROTO_SWAR_BITS
 * and every constant follows it. That knob defaults to the register width the die declares in
 * core_setup/board_profiles/, so nothing here infers a width from the toolchain.
 *
 * **This is the access layer.** Load a word, test its lanes, name the lane that fired. Nothing here
 * walks a buffer or takes a capacity, which is what keeps the byte-order claim under
 * ::protocore_swar_zero_lane true: a lane count is the one place address order is decided, and stepping
 * across a word pair is not this file's business. The scans, compares, searches and the bounded copy
 * built on these live in mmgr/protostr.h, behind @ref str.
 *
 * **Constant time.** Every operation here is branchless and data-independent, which is why the
 * base64 decoder classifies characters with ::protocore_swar_ge and ::protocore_swar_le rather than a table: an
 * address derived from a secret byte leaks it through the cache, and an arithmetic mask cannot. The
 * walks behind @ref str are NOT in that class - they stop at the byte they find, which is the whole
 * point of a bounded scan. Never run one over a secret.

 * one bit that carries ASCII case - restricted to lanes where flipping that bit still names the same
 * letter. Clearing bit 5 of the syndrome on exactly those lanes IS the test: a lane falls to zero
 * when its syndrome was in the class, and a lane with any second bit set survives.
 *
 * So there is nothing to ask afterwards. Testing whether the syndrome WAS 0x20 re-derives what
 * clearing the bit decides, and widening a 0x80 lane mask to 0xFF to mask it back down to 0x20
 * spends three operations moving a bit two places that a shift moves in one without leaving its
 * lane. 13 operations per word.
 *
 * Branchless, like every other lane test here: a zero syndrome stays zero through every step, so an
 * early-out would spend a branch on parts where a mispredict costs more than it skipped.
 *
 * ORing 0x20 into one side puts both cases of a letter in `a`..`z`, so the letter test is one range
 * rather than two - and only one side needs testing, because a lane whose two sides disagree in any
 * bit but 5 fails on that bit regardless of what this decides.
 *
 * ASCII only, deliberately. Every field this serves is defined as ASCII by its own standard (an HTTP
 * field name, RFC 7230 3.2; a Connection or Upgrade token; an SMTP verb), so treating any other byte
 * as having a case would be inventing a rule no spec here states.
 *
 * `& ~lo` is what holds that line, and it is not decoration. ::protocore_swar_ge and ::protocore_swar_le answer
 * for 7-bit lanes: the guard bit they borrow into is already set on a lane above 0x7F, so the
 * comparison it was standing in for is gone and such a lane range-tests as a letter. 0xDB and 0xFB
 * differ by exactly the case bit and would have been accepted as a case pair - a Latin-1 or UTF-8
 * byte silently matching a different one. The mask keeps a lane out of the range test's answer
 * whenever bit 7 says the answer is not the test's to give.
