 * @file plaintext.h
 * @brief Plaintext pool accessor - transient borrows whose bytes are not secret.
 *
 * Fixed BSS arenas that codec / protocol handlers borrow transient working
 * memory from, instead of each feature carrying its own dedicated scratch
 * buffer. Many such buffers are mutually exclusive in time - a connection is
 * doing HTTP *or* WebSocket *or* SSH at any instant, and a worker runs one
 * event to completion before the next - so overlapping them in one arena cuts
 * peak RAM without weakening the zero-heap / deterministic guarantee (fixed
 * size, no runtime growth).
 *
 * There is one arena per slot (::PROTOCORE_REG_POOL_SLOTS): one per server worker, plus
 * the ghost, which is the library's own. protocore_plaintext_alloc() resolves the
 * caller's slot with protocore_worker_self(), so a borrow never crosses workers.
 *
 * **Model - region reset per dispatch.** protocore_plaintext_alloc() bump-allocates from the
 * caller's arena; protocore_plaintext_reset() empties that one arena in O(1).
 * dispatch_event() calls protocore_plaintext_reset() before handing an event to its
 * protocol handler, so a borrow is valid only until the handler returns. There
 * is no per-allocation free - the whole arena is reclaimed at once.
 *
 * **Race-safety.** Each arena has exactly one accessor - the worker that owns
 * its slot - so allocation is a plain bump with no lock. Work reaches a worker
 * through its queue, so a context that is not a worker never borrows: the
 * network stack's callbacks run on its own thread and only fill the rx ring +
 * enqueue events, and an ISR posts a fixed-size item to a preempt-queue lane
 * whose task does the work. In debug builds an owner assertion
 * (protocore_platform_context_id()) records the first context to touch each arena
 * and fails loud if a second one does, turning a future mistake into an
 * immediate visible failure instead of a silent cross-core race.
 *
 * **Exhaustion-safety.** Borrows live only within one dispatch and are
 * auto-reclaimed by the reset, so a forgotten free cannot accumulate (no
 * creeping exhaustion). An over-budget protocore_plaintext_alloc() returns NULL; every
 * caller must take a defined fail-closed path (drop the optional optimization,
 * close the connection, answer 503) and must never dereference a null borrow.
 *
 * **No implicit zeroing.** protocore_plaintext_alloc() returns uninitialized memory and the
 * reset does not wipe. This pool is for plaintext: anything whose bytes are key
 * material belongs in the secure pool (mmgr/secure.h), which is the same
 * mechanism with one added control - reclaiming wipes, before the bytes become
 * available again.
