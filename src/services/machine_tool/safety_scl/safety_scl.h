 * @file safety_scl.h
 * @brief IEC 61784-3 black-channel Safety Communication Layer - the shared primitives
 *        (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_SAFETY_SCL).
 *
 * The functional-safety profiles (PROFIsafe / IEC 61784-3-3, CIP Safety / -3-2, FSoE / -3-12,
 * IO-Link Safety) all work the same way: they treat the underlying fieldbus as an untrusted "black
 * channel" and layer their own end-to-end checks on top, so the transport may corrupt, lose,
 * duplicate, delay or reorder frames without defeating the safety function. Three mechanisms do that
 * work, and they are common to every profile:
 *
 *   1. a **CRC signature** over the safety payload, sized so the residual error rate meets SIL 3,
 *   2. a **monitoring / consecutive counter**, which turns lost, repeated, inserted and reordered
 *      frames into a detectable mismatch, and
 *   3. a **receive watchdog**, so a silent channel is itself a fault rather than a stale-but-happy
 *      reading.
 *
 * This module lands (2) and (3) plus the fail-safe state machine that combines all three, so each
 * profile's codec composes them instead of reimplementing them.
 *
 * **What this module deliberately does not do: compute the CRC.** Every profile defines its own
 * polynomial, width, seed, and the order in which payload / counter / connection identifier are fed
 * into it, and those constants live in paid standards. Encoding a guess here would produce something
 * that looks authoritative and silently fails to detect the very corruptions it exists to catch -
 * the worst possible outcome for a safety layer. So the caller computes its profile's CRC and passes
 * the verdict in as @p signature_ok. What this module owns is the *consequence* of that verdict,
 * which genuinely is profile-independent.
 *
 * **Fail-safe latches.** Once any check fails the connection enters @ref SCL_STATE_FAILSAFE and stays
 * there until an explicit @ref protocore_scl_reset. A safety layer must never silently reheal: recovering
 * on its own would let an intermittent fault present as a working connection, which is precisely the
 * failure a SIL rating is meant to exclude. Re-establishing is an operator/application decision.
 *
 * Pure, with an explicit @p now (the `services/hotswap` pattern - it decides, the binding acts), so
 * the whole machine is host-testable against a synthetic clock. Every elapsed-time test is an
 * unsigned difference, so it is wrap-safe across a `millis()` rollover. No heap, no stdlib.
