 * @brief CoAP over DTLS (CoAPs, RFC 7252 §9) - the bridge between the DTLS 1.3 server and the CoAP
 *        request handler.
 *
 * CoAP secured with DTLS is the standard way to run CoAP over the open Internet (coaps://, UDP port
 * 5684). This is the transport-neutral glue: it drives one @ref DtlsConn through its handshake and,
 * once established, unwraps each encrypted application record, hands the CoAP request to
 * pc_coap_server_process(), and re-wraps the response. The socket / per-peer routing lives in a thin
 * front-end (pc_dtls_server) on top; this file has no sockets, so it is host-testable with an in-test
 * DTLS client, exactly like pc_dtls_conn itself.

 * While the handshake is in progress the datagram is driven through @ref DtlsServer.process. Once the
 * connection is established, an epoch-3 application record is decrypted, its CoAP request is answered
 * by pc_coap_server_process(), and the response is sealed as an epoch-3 record. A handshake record that
 * arrives after establishment (a retransmitted client Finished whose ACK was lost) is routed back to
 * the state machine so it is re-acknowledged (RFC 9147 §5.8.3).
 *
 * @return bytes written to @p out (0 if there is nothing to send), or -1 on a fatal handshake error
