/**
 * @file spa_router.h
 * @brief Single-page-app micro-routing + conditional UI streaming (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_SPA_ROUTER).
 *
 * A single-page web UI does its own client-side routing: the browser navigates to `/dashboard` or
 * `/devices/42`, but there is no such file on the device - the server must return the app shell
 * (`index.html`) and let the JavaScript router take over, while still serving real asset files
 * (`/app.js`, `/style.css`) and letting API calls (`/api/...`) fall through to their handlers. This is
 * that routing decision: given a request path, return whether to serve the file, serve the shell, or
 * pass through to the app.
 *
 * The rule: a path under a configured API prefix passes through; a path whose last segment has a file
 * extension (a dot) is a real asset request; anything else is a client route and gets the shell. Pure,
 * zero heap, no stdlib, host-testable; the caller wires the result into serve_static / the router.
 *
 * ### The fallback HMI
 *
 * On a machine-control device the SPA is a convenience, not the contract. If the shell asset is
 * missing (a half-finished upload, a wiped filesystem), the client will not run scripts, or the
 * device itself is degraded, an operator still has to be able to see state and actuate something. So
 * a client route can resolve to PROTOCORE_SPA_SERVE_FALLBACK instead: a plain server-rendered control page
 * needing no JavaScript and no asset files. The API prefix keeps passing through in that mode - a
 * fallback page whose endpoints have stopped answering is decoration.
 *
 * ### Conditional UI streaming
 *
 * That page is assembled from fragments, each with a predicate, and streamed in caller-sized chunks:
 * only the panels whose condition currently holds are emitted, and a page far larger than any single
 * buffer never has to fit in RAM. The same streamer serves any conditional UI - showing an operator
 * only the panels their role, or the machine's current state, warrants.
