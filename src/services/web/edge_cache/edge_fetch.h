 * A non-blocking origin fetch: open + send a request over a transport seam, accumulate the response
 * across poll loops into a bounded buffer, detect completion (Content-Length / chunked / connection
 * close), then parse it with the proven http_client codec. Pumped from the server poll loop so a miss
 * or revalidation never stalls the worker; the transport seam is pc_client on the device and a mock in
 * host tests. Zero heap; the buffer is fixed (`PC_EDGE_FETCH_BUF`).
