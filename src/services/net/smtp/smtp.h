/**
 * @file smtp.h
 * @brief Outbound SMTP client (RFC 5321) - send a device email alert.
 *
 * A blocking one-shot: connect, greet, optional AUTH LOGIN, then MAIL FROM / RCPT TO /
 * DATA a plain-text message and QUIT. It rides the shared outbound client transport
 * (`protocore_client`), with implicit TLS (SMTPS, typically port 465) when the config sets
 * `tls` and PROTOCORE_ENABLE_TLS is on. Zero heap; every buffer is a compile-time size
 * (`PROTOCORE_SMTP_*`). Gated by PROTOCORE_ENABLE_SMTP.
 *
 * The dialogue itself (smtp_run) is written against a send/recv seam, so the whole
 * protocol exchange - greeting codes, AUTH, dot-stuffing, the terminating `.` - is
 * unit-tested on the host with a scripted mock server, no lwIP or TLS required.
 *
 * "SMS fallback" needs no extra code: most mobile carriers accept an email-to-SMS
 * gateway address (e.g. `5551234567@txt.example.net`) as the recipient.
