/**
 * @file http_delivery.h
 * @brief HTTP delivery optimizations: stale-while-revalidate, Range/206 delta fetch, SW precache
 *        (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_HTTP_DELIVERY).
 *
 * Three pure cores that make HTTP serving cheaper on a constrained device, each mapping to a real web
 * standard:
 *
 *  - **Stale-while-revalidate** (RFC 5861): given a cached response's age and its `max-age` +
 *    `stale-while-revalidate` windows, decide FRESH / serve-stale-and-revalidate / EXPIRED, and build the
 *    matching `Cache-Control` header so a browser keeps the UI responsive while the device refreshes in
 *    the background.
 *  - **Delta / offset log fetch** (RFC 7233 byte ranges): parse a `Range: bytes=...` request against a
 *    resource of known length (all three forms - `X-Y`, `X-`, `-N`), and build the `Content-Range` header
 *    for the `206 Partial Content` reply, so a client streams only the new tail of a growing log.
 *  - **Service-worker precache manifest**: emit the versioned `{"version":..,"precache":[..]}` JSON a
 *    generated service worker consumes to cache-inject the app shell for offline / instant loads.
 *
 * Pure, zero heap, no stdlib (hand-rolled decimal parse/format), host-testable.
