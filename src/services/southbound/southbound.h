 * @file southbound.h
 * @brief Southbound protocol-driver framework (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_SOUTHBOUND).
 *
 * The northbound surface of this library is HTTP/WS/SNMP/etc. to a controller; the *southbound* surface
 * is the field devices it polls and drives (a Modbus slave, a BACnet controller, a raw sensor over
 * SPI/I2C/UART). Today Modbus master is the one such driver, hand-wired by the app. This is the uniform
 * seam every southbound driver plugs into, so the app addresses any field device the same way regardless
 * of the wire protocol underneath: register a driver (a small vtable + its instance context), then
 * read/write *points* (registers, coils, objects) by driver name through one facade.
 *
 * One owner, one API: the framework owns driver lookup + dispatch; each driver owns its own transport
 * (it is handed the point id and returns the value, doing whatever Modbus/BACnet/GPIO I/O it needs). The
 * block (matrix) read/write is the atomic multi-point path - a contiguous span of points moved in one
 * driver call, which a protocol like Modbus can satisfy as a single request.
 *
 * Pure registry + dispatch: no heap, no stdlib, host-testable with a fake driver. Drivers are borrowed
 * (the caller keeps the SouthboundDriver + its ctx alive for the registry's lifetime).
