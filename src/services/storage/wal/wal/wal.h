/**
 * @file wal.h
 * @brief Write-ahead journal for atomic buffer-to-flash storage (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_WAL).
 *
 * A power-loss-safe write-ahead log, the substrate for on-device data stores (dbm / sqlite / nosql). It
 * is built to the envelope measured on real hardware (docs/FEATURE_PERFORMANCE.md): an SD card over SPI
 * writes ~1.5 MB/s sequentially but only ~40-100 durable random IOPS with 100+ ms tail spikes, and the
 * durable-throughput knee is a ~32 KiB write with a flush every ~128-256 KiB. So the log **appends
 * sequentially** in fixed pages and checkpoints in bulk, never scattering small durable writes.
 *
 * **On-media record framing (this file - increment 1, pure + host-tested):** each record is
 *
 *     [magic u32][seq u64][len u32][crc u32][payload len bytes]   (little-endian; ::WAL_RECORD_HEADER = 20)
 *
 * where `crc` is a CRC-32 (IEEE 802.3) over the 16 header bytes plus the payload. Recovery on mount walks
 * records from the start and **stops at the first record with a bad magic, a bad CRC, or a truncated tail**
 * - i.e. the torn write left by a power loss - so a crash costs at most the last, un-checkpointed record.
 * This is the atomicity core, and it is pure (no I/O) so it is fully host-testable: feed it a journal
 * image with a corrupted or truncated tail and it recovers to the last good record.
 *
 * The durable store layer - A/B superblock, checkpoint, and mount/recover over a block-device seam - is
 * built on this codec in protocore_wal_store.h; protocore_wal_fs.h binds that seam to a real fs::FS file (SD /
 * LittleFS). The whole path is hardware-verified on an SD card over SPI (checkpoint recovery, torn-tail drop,
 * byte-level payload persistence, and survival across a chip reset all pass).
