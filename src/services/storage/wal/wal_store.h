/**
 * @file protocore_wal_store.h
 * @brief Durable write-ahead store: A/B superblock + checkpoint over a block-device seam (PROTOCORE_ENABLE_WAL).
 *
 * Increment 2 on top of the pure record codec in wal.h. It turns the codec into a mountable, power-loss-safe
 * append log on a fixed backing region (a preallocated file on any fs::FS - SD card or LittleFS - or any RAM
 * buffer for host tests). All I/O goes through a ::WalDev of three function pointers, so the superblock and
 * checkpoint logic is pure and fully host-testable over a RAM device.
 *
 * **On-media layout** of the backing region:
 *
 *     [ superblock A : WAL_SUPER_SIZE ][ superblock B : WAL_SUPER_SIZE ][ WAL data region ... ]
 *
 * Records (wal.h framing) are **appended sequentially** into the data region and are *not* synced per op -
 * that matches the measured envelope (docs/FEATURE_PERFORMANCE.md): batch, then checkpoint in bulk.
 *
 * **Checkpoint = the atomic commit.** ::protocore_wal_store_checkpoint syncs the appended data, then writes an updated
 * superblock (with an incremented generation, the new durable head, and the next seq) to the *inactive* of
 * the two copies and syncs that. Flipping which copy is newest is the single durable pointer move. If a
 * crash tears the new superblock, its CRC fails and mount falls back to the older copy; either way mount
 * then **replays the tail** past the committed head - each record is self-validating (CRC), so records
 * appended after the last checkpoint are still recovered, and recovery stops at the first torn record.
 *
 * So durability is layered: the superblock bounds how far mount must scan, and the per-record CRC provides
 * the actual atomicity. A crash costs at most the last, un-appended (torn) record.
