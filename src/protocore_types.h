 * @file protocore_types.h
 * @brief The primitive types every other file is written in, and the one place <stdint.h> and
 *        <stddef.h> appear.
 *
 * A library that targets xtensa, riscv, arm and c2000 cannot spend a type it has not established.
 * `uint8_t` is optional in C11 - a conforming implementation omits it when it has no 8-bit type,
 * which is exactly the c2000 case, where a byte is 16 bits wide. Naming the widths once here makes
 * that one file to port and one place to look.
 *
 * **Widths are stated, never inherited.** `size_t` is the type this file exists to replace at an
 * offset or a length. Its width is whatever the target's pointer happens to be, so the same
 * expression is 32-bit index math on a device and 64-bit on the host that tests it - different
 * emitted code from the same source, which is the one thing this library does not accept.
 * ::proto_idx is a stated width the build can override, so the arithmetic has the same shape
 * everywhere.
 *
 * **Narrow values are carried in the register width.** On every ISA in the target list an operation
 * narrower than the register costs an extra mask or sign-extend to keep the unused half honest, so
 * the cheapest 16-bit index on a 32-bit part is a 32-bit one truncated at the boundary, exactly as
 * a 32-bit index on a 64-bit host is. ::proto_word is that register width.

 * declared inside a struct is BSS, so without this the same connection slot is one size on an ESP32
