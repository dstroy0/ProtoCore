 * @file rng.c
 * @brief The seed each worker inherits, and the draw over it.
 *
 * The seed is key material a worker holds for the life of the program, so it is a persistent borrow
 * from that worker's secure pool rather than declared storage: the pool is what hands out aligned
 * bytes and wipes them on reclaim. The slot resolves itself out of the caller's worker the same way
 * every other pool borrow does, so nothing is passed in and no caller is told which seed it uses.
 *
 * A draw takes its keystream under the current seed and replaces the seed from that same keystream
 * before returning. Block 0 supplies the replacement and the caller's bytes start at block 1, so no
 * byte is both handed out and kept, and the state that produced a value is gone by the time the
 * value is. Every PC_RAND_RESEED_BYTES the seed is redrawn from the platform instead.
