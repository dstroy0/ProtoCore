/**
 * @file aes256ctr.h
 * @brief AES-256-CTR stream cipher (aes256-ctr, RFC 4344 §4) - stateless one-shot API.
 *
 * AES-256-CTR is the mandatory cipher for this SSH implementation. CTR mode turns AES into a stream
 * cipher: each 16-byte counter block is AES-ECB encrypted to produce a keystream block, and data is
 * XOR'd with the keystream. Encrypt and decrypt are the identical operation.
 *
 * STATELESS API (mirrors chachapoly.h)
 * ────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no context object. The caller keeps the two things that must persist across packets - the
 * 32-byte key and the 16-byte counter - as plain bytes (SshKeyMat holds them, exactly as it holds the
 * raw chacha20-poly1305 key), and passes both in on every call. The AES key schedule is rebuilt per call
 * in the secure pool and wiped when released, so expanded key material never lives in
 * BSS or on the stack - every crypto secret is funneled through the one hardened, wiped scratch region
 * (mmgr/secure.h). @p counter is advanced in place by ceil(@p len / 16) blocks so successive calls
 * continue the stream.
 *
 * COUNTER FORMAT (RFC 4344 §4)
 * The 16-byte counter increments as a big-endian 128-bit integer after each 16-byte keystream block.
 * The initial counter is the IV from the key exchange (RFC 4253 §7.2, labels 'A'/'B').
 *
 * @note The SSH binary packet is always a whole number of cipher blocks, so every call is block-aligned
 *       and the counter alone is sufficient state. A non-block-aligned @p len is permitted only as the
 *       final call of a stream (any leftover keystream in the last block is discarded, not carried).
 *
 * On Arduino (ESP32) the AES block is mbedtls, routed to the hardware AES accelerator; on native host
 * builds a compact software AES-256 is used so the cipher is unit-testable off-target.
