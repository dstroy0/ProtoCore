/**
 * @file aesgcm.h
 * @brief AES-256-GCM AEAD (RFC 5116) - stateless, detached-tag API.
 *
 * A key is a per-connection object, so this is a KEYED api: build a context once from the 32-byte key
 * with protocore_aesgcm_key_init(), then seal or open each record against it. There is deliberately no
 * raw-key one-shot. Standing a cipher context up and tearing it down costs ~9,200 cycles on an
 * ESP32-S3 once the AES peripheral has actually been used - a FIXED cost per call, so roughly 10%% of a
 * 1 KiB record, 30%% of a 256 B TLS record, and most of a small interactive SSH packet. A one-shot
 * entry point would have let every caller pay that without seeing it.
 *
 * The context holds an expanded key schedule for as long as the caller holds it, so it belongs in the
 * caller's secure storage and must be wiped on rekey and on close. This is not a new exposure: the raw
 * key is already resident for exactly that long, and the schedule is derivable from it.
 *
 * Used by SSH aes256-gcm@openssh.com (RFC 5647: advance the invocation counter with
 * protocore_aesgcm_iv_increment after every packet) and SMB 3.x transport encryption.
 *
 * The implementation is a backend under core_setup/ selected by the vendor's PROTOCORE_HAS_HW_AESGCM.
 * Host-tested byte-exact against the NIST/McGrew AES-256-GCM vectors.
