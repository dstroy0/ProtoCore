/**
 * @file speed_opt.h
 * @brief Build one file at a named optimization level instead of the framework's.
 *
 * The framework's size-optimized level is appended after any build-system flags, so a consumer
 * cannot raise it from outside. That level declines to inline small functions, and an appender
 * chain that does not inline cannot fold: a literal's length stays a runtime scan and a bounded
 * copy stays a call. Put @ref PROTOCORE_OPTIMIZE_O2 at the top of such a `.cpp`, after its includes.
 *
 * The level is in the name rather than behind a knob, so a file states what it is built at and a
 * reader does not have to resolve a second macro to find out. A macro rather than the pragma itself
 * because core carries no toolchain language.
 *
 * O2 is the only level defined here (see docs/FEATURE_PERFORMANCE.md 2b). A file that needs another
 * level adds the macro for it here rather than redefining this one.
 *
 * Apply only where there are no secrets or the code is constant-time by structure. An optimizer can
 * turn a branchless mask-select into a data-dependent branch; `crypto/crypto_opt.h` is the crypto
 * policy layer with per-die levels and those caveats.
