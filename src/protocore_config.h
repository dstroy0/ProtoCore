 *
 * **Compile-time sizing constants**
 * These govern static array dimensions and must be set before the first
 * library header is included.  Define any of them in your sketch or in a
 * build flag before including this file to override the defaults:
 * @code
 *   // platformio.ini
 *   build_flags = -DMAX_CONNS=8 -DBODY_BUF_SIZE=512
 * @endcode
 *
 * **Runtime parameters - flash or RAM, your choice**
 * `WebServerConfig` holds values that can be changed without a rebuild.
 * On ESP32, `PROGMEM` is a no-op (const data lands in DROM automatically).
 * On AVR it places data in flash and requires `pgm_read_*` accessors - this
 * library targets ESP32 only, so both forms read identically via pointer:
 * @code
 *   // Flash (PROGMEM, no RAM cost at runtime):
 *   const WebServerConfig my_cfg PROGMEM = { .conn_timeout_ms = 10000 };
 *
 *   // RAM (can be changed at runtime):
 *   WebServerConfig my_cfg = { .conn_timeout_ms = 10000 };
 *
 *   begin_http(80, &my_cfg);
 * @endcode
 * Pass `NULL` to use the built-in default (`CONN_TIMEOUT_MS`, 5000 ms idle
 * timeout).

 * @brief Largest outbound payload permessage-deflate will compress, in bytes.
 *
 * The compressor borrows `len + len/8 + 16` from the scratch arena, so an unbounded outbound length
 * would leave the arena with no worst case - `Ws.frame.len` is a `uint16_t`, and neither
 * WS_FRAME_SIZE (which bounds the *inbound* reassembled message) nor PROTOCORE_WS_FRAG_SIZE (off by
 * default, and a runtime setter besides) constrains it. This is that bound, and it is what makes
 * PROTOCORE_PLAINTEXT_WORK_WS_SEND a compile-time constant.
 *
 * A larger message is still sent, uncompressed, as the per-message RSV1 flag makes legal - the same
 * outcome as before this was declared, except chosen rather than reached by an allocation failure.
 * Raising it costs arena: the term grows by roughly 1.125x the increase.

 * Deliberately NOT keyed on NDEBUG. Whether NDEBUG is defined is a property of whichever toolchain
 * happens to build the library - the Arduino ESP32 core does not define it - so keying on it means
 * nobody actually chose. This is the switch we control.
 *
 * What it enables today: the pools' owner tripwire, which records the first execution context to
 * touch each slot and asserts every later borrow matches. That catches a borrow crossing tasks - the
 * one way the lock-free single-accessor invariant can break - and turns a silent cross-core race into
 * an immediate failure.
 *
 * Measured cost on an ESP32-S3 at 240 MHz: ~52 cycles per pool entry point, and a
 * mark + alloc + release touches three of them, so roughly 156 cycles on every borrow. Worth paying
 * while chasing a memory bug; not worth shipping.

// ESP32 has 320 KB of SRAM; the library uses ~5–18 KB depending on features.
// Stack usage is separate; the largest frame is during SSH DH key exchange
// (~256 B for the protocore_bignum private scalar on the call stack before it is
// zeroed by ssh_dh_finish()).
//
// SSH KEY MATERIAL IS NOT IN THE TABLE ABOVE intentionally:
//   - The RSA host private key is NEVER stored in any static array.  It is
//     loaded from NVS into a local stack frame at sign time, used once, then
//     explicitly zeroed (volatile memset) before the function returns.
//   - AES session keys and HMAC keys live in ssh_keys[] (above), which is a
//     separate BSS symbol from ssh_pool[].  Physical separation means a
//     buffer overflow in the packet receive path (ssh_pool[].pkt_buf) cannot
//     reach the key material without crossing a distinct linker symbol - a
//     significant barrier against heap/BSS spray attacks.
//   - The DH ephemeral private scalar y lives in ssh_dh[].y and is zeroed
//     immediately after the shared secret K is derived.
//   - crypto_work[] is zeroed via protocore_secure_wipe() after every use so that
//     bignum intermediates (including partial products that contain key
//     material) do not persist in memory.
