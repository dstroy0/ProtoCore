# The src/ law

The determinism and allocation rules every `src/` file obeys, derived from the safety-critical
standards in the bibliography. Two companion documents carry the other halves:

- [SRCBANNED.md](SRCBANNED.md) - the exact constructs banned in `src/`, enforced by
  `tools/ci_tooling/check/check_src_banned.py`.
- [SYMBOLS.md](SYMBOLS.md) - the naming law, enforced by `tools/ci_tooling/check/check_symbols.py`.

## 0. The language is C11

**`src/, test/, test/core_setup/` are C11.** `.c` and `.h` are the only extensions allowed. `.cpp` is only
allowed in `test/core_setup/` as vendor supplied headers. `examples/` are split by vendor, `.cpp` is
allowed here.

## Real-time and object allocation

1. **Zero runtime heap allocation** (MISRA Directive 4.12)
    - Rule: `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` are never called. There is no
      pre-initialization exception. `<stdlib>` is banned outright.

2. **Static stack sizing, no VLAs** (Rule 18.8)
    - Rule: all task stacks and local hardware buffers are bounded by a compile-time constant.
      Variable-length arrays are prohibited. Function-local arrays are prohibited.
      ([SRCBANNED.md](SRCBANNED.md) #19).
    - Rationale: makes maximum stack depth provable before deployment.

## Time-slice determinism and control flow

3. **Every hardware wait carries a timeout** (Rule A15-0-1 alternate)
    - Rule: a peripheral polling loop, a bus read, or a synchronization wait has an explicit tick or
      counter timeout. An infinite `while` on a hardware status flag is banned.
    - Rationale: a failed or hung part breaks the thread out inside its assigned time slice.

4. **No unstructured control flow** (the `goto` ban)
    - Rule: `goto` is banned, as is a `break` or `continue` that alters the regular conditional
      hierarchy.
    - Rationale: keeps the control-flow graph scannable, so worst-case execution time is computable.

5. **No evaluative increments** (the single side-effect rule)
    - Rule: `++` and `--` do not appear inside a larger expression or an array subscript. Write
      `buffer[idx] = val; idx++;`, never `buffer[idx++] = val;`.
    - Rationale: removes evaluation-order variation between compilers.

6. **No return-type deduction or variant types** (Rule A8-4-13)
    - Rule: `auto` is banned everywhere, including a local ([SRCBANNED.md](SRCBANNED.md) #3).
      Dynamically sized or variant types that change footprint at runtime are prohibited.
    - Rationale: keeps memory access boundaries and copy overheads identical across every time slice.

## Type conversion and explicit memory

7. **Explicit initialization at the declaration** (Rule 9.1)
    - Rule: every object is given its value where it is declared.
      bounded recasting is allowed. `ex: **void->**uint32_t` is fine if you know the width.
      In general, memory is bound by a secure/plaintext pool, and the mmgr will return unavailable
      on out of bounds read/write.

8. **Casts appear only at a boundary** (Rules 11.3, 11.4)
    - Rule: a cast is written where a value crosses out of the library's own type system: a byte read
      off the wire, a width narrowed into a field, a vendor API that demands its own type. A cast
      written to make a type error compile is banned, and so is one that discards `const` or converts
      between pointers to different object types.
    - Rationale: C performs the conversion either way; the cast only decides whether it is written
      down. Confining casts to boundaries makes the set of places a width or a sign can change a
      short list a reviewer can read.

9. **No implicit pointer-to-boolean evaluation**
    - Rule: `if (dev_ptr)` is banned. Comparisons are written out against `NULL`.
    - Rationale: removes type ambiguity at the branch.

10. **Explicit unused-return serialization** (Rule 17.7)
    - Rule: a non-void function is never called without handling its return. An intentionally skipped
      status is discarded with `(void)function();`.
    - Rationale: makes an omitted error check a documented decision rather than an oversight.

## Preprocessor and structural integrity

11. **No `#undef`**
    - Rule: `#undef` never strips or modifies an established preprocessor identifier.
    - Rationale: keeps feature configuration static from the first line of code to the last.

12. **No variadics** (Rule A8-4-1)
    - Rule: functions and macros taking `...` are banned.
    - Rationale: ellipsis bypasses compile-time type checks and introduces non-deterministic stack
      sequences during runtime parsing.

13. **No comment-terminating backslash** (Rule A2-7-1)
    - Rule: `\` is never the final character of a single-line comment.
    - Rationale: prevents the preprocessor merging the next line into the comment.

## Guarantees are proven at the binary

Where ProtoCore promises a behavior, the promise is checked against the emitted instructions, not
argued from the source. C makes the source readable as cost, but reading is not proof. The claims
that get this treatment are the ones a caller depends on:

- **Constant-time** comparisons and crypto: no branch and no memory access depends on a secret.
- **No heap after `begin()`**: no allocator call reachable in the relevant `.text`.
- **Bounded interrupt and critical-section paths**: a counted worst case, not an estimate.

Each is documented as claim, then disassembly, then why the disassembly establishes the claim. A
guarantee without that chain is a comment, and comments do not survive a compiler upgrade.
