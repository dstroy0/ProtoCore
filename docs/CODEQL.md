# CodeQL static analysis

The C/C++ sources are scanned with [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) for
security and quality issues.

## In CI

The [CodeQL workflow](../.github/workflows/codeql.yml) runs on every push and
pull request to `main` (and weekly). It is an **advanced** setup: the database is
built by tracing a host/native PlatformIO compile of the security-critical cores
(HTTP parser, WebSocket, multipart, base64 / JSON, the SSH crypto stack, SNMP,
and the protocol / codec services), then analyzed with the `security-and-quality`
query suite. Results appear under the repository's **Security -> Code scanning**
tab.

The workflow publishes a code-scanning check named **`CodeQL`** - require that
context in the branch-protection rule / ruleset for `main`. If GitHub "default"
code scanning is enabled for C/C++, disable it (Settings -> Code security -> Code
scanning) so this advanced workflow runs instead.

## Running locally

Create a database by tracing a native build, then analyze it. Use the same env
set as the workflow so local coverage matches CI - `native_codeql` is the full
app compiled with every feature flag on, so the integration paths (CSRF /
lockout / allowlist gates, permessage-deflate) and the new service modules are
traced, not just the per-feature cores:

```sh
codeql database create cpp-db --language=cpp \
  --command="pio test --without-testing -e native_codeql -e native_ssh \
    -e native_snmp_v3 -e native_inflate -e native_deflate -e native_coap \
    -e native_webdav -e native_modbus -e native_mqtt -e native_ws_client \
    -e native_http_client -e native_jwt"

codeql database analyze cpp-db \
  codeql/cpp-queries:codeql-suites/cpp-security-and-quality.qls \
  --format=sarif-latest --output=cpp.sarif --download
```

The native environments compile the host-portable code (parsers, codecs, the
software crypto paths). The ESP32-only wrappers - NVS, the mbedTLS / lwIP glue,
mDNS - are thin SDK adapters not traced here. A local run reproduces the hosted
GitHub CodeQL result byte-for-byte (same engine, suite, and traced build).

## Findings

_Latest scan: `security-and-quality` suite over the full CI env set
(`native_codeql` + 10 protocol / codec envs), 2026-06-26; 113 of 240 C/C++ files
analyzed. Verified byte-for-byte against the hosted GitHub CodeQL run._

**No security (CWE) findings.** The memory-safety queries (buffer overflow,
integer overflow, use-after-free, tainted path, invalid pointer deref, etc.) all
ran and reported nothing in `src/`. The remaining results are low-severity
quality / maintainability items - 11 in `src/`, the rest in tests, mocks, and the
vendored Unity headers.

| `cpp/long-switch`                | `http_parser.c:187`, `src/network_drivers/presentation/ssh/ssh_server.c:39`, `websocket.c:279` | **Won't fix (style)** - protocol state machines / message dispatchers; a long `switch` is the clearest form.                                                                                                                           |

### Tests / mocks / vendored (not production code)

`cpp/irregular-enum-init` (vendored `Unity/unity_internals.h`),
`cpp/stack-address-escape` (`test/mocks/FS.h`, a test double),
`cpp/offset-use-before-range-check` and the remaining `cpp/unused-*` (under
`test/`). No action - test / third-party code.
