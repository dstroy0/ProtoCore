# Architecture & internal data piping

How bytes and control flow move between the OSI-style layers and who owns each
cross-layer concern. This is the map referenced by the internal-piping cleanup: the
rule is **one owner per cross-layer concern, behind a clean API** - no layer reaches
into another's internals, and a function that needs a resource asks that resource's
owner for it. Both axes are now settled: the data-piping axis (who owns
RX / TX / window / events / memory / streaming / client I/O) and the dispatch axis
(how each protocol attaches) both meet the one-uniform-seam rule, with no protocol
special-cased. The piping is straight; what remains below is the map, not a to-do.

## Layers

  datalink/     L2 framing concerns
  network/      IPv4 / interface tagging (pc_if_kind: STA vs AP)
  transport/    lwIP raw-API callbacks, the per-connection RX ring, the TcpEvt
                event queue, and the pc_conn_* I/O API. OWNS all socket I/O.
  tls/          mbedTLS record layer (static-pool BIO) - plaintext <-> ciphertext

src/services/         mqtt, modbus, opcua, snmp, coap, ... (protocol features)
src/mmgr/       the memory manager: the two pools every borrow comes from
                (plaintext, secure), the arena mechanism under both, the byte
                region that carries its own bound (span), and every operation
                that moves a byte (mem, str, swar, endian, ring, membuild,
                frame). See "mmgr" below.
src/shared_primitives/  layer-agnostic primitives shared across the tree so
                logic is never duplicated: crc.h (one parameterized CRC engine),
                hex.h (base-16), mime.h (the Content-Type vocabulary), utf8.h
                (RFC 3629 validation), http_date.h (IMF-fixdate), ip.h (a
                family-tagged IP address), can.h, pcap.h, log.h, and types.h (the
                one place <stdint.h> appears). Two more shared concerns live in
                their natural module instead of here: base64url (base64 module,
                used by JWT + OIDC) and host->IP resolution
                (network_drivers/network/dns/dns_resolver, used by the
                server-adjacent code AND pc_client, so a client has one DNS owner).
core_setup/     NOT under src/: board profiles (per-die sizing and capability
                macros), the crypto HAL, and the pc_platform selector.
```

## Two threads, two boundaries

The server is a 2-thread system and every cross-layer hazard lives on one of two
boundaries:

1. **tcpip_thread (Core 0, producer)** runs the lwIP callbacks: `lowlevel_recv_cb`
   copies an inbound segment into the connection's RX ring and posts a `TcpEvt`;
   `lowlevel_sent_cb` nudges the owning worker; `listener_accept_cb` assigns a new
   slot its owner worker.
2. **worker task(s) (Core 1, consumer)** run `service_once()` -> `server_tick()`
   (drain the event queue -> `dispatch_event` -> `ProtoHandler::on_data`) then a
   per-slot pump (`on_poll`, the HTTP/WS/SSE inline pump, the file/chunk send pumps).

Cross-thread synchronization primitives (no hot-path locks):

- `pc_atomic<>` (acquire/release) on `TcpConn::state`, `rx_head`, `rx_tail`.
- The FreeRTOS `TcpEvt` queue (producer -> owner worker).
- `tcpip_api_call` marshaling for the app->lwIP direction (see TX below).

## TX path - clean, single owner (transport)

Every layer that sends bytes calls the transport API; nobody calls lwIP `tcp_*`
directly:

```
app / presentation  -->  Tcp.conn->send / Tcp.conn->flush / pc_conn_sndbuf
                         (TLS slots route through pc_tls_write)
                              |
                         pc_tcp_marshal (PC_OP_*)  -->  tcpip_thread: tcp_write / tcp_output
```

The **same marshal rule covers every raw lwIP call, not just app data**: the TCP
listener bring-up (`listener_add` / `Tcp.listener->stop`), the UDP transport (`pc_udp_*`,
used by SNMP / CoAP / captive-DNS / syslog / telemetry), the outbound client
(`pc_client`), and the DNS resolver all route their `tcp_*` / `udp_*` through
`tcpip_api_call`. This is mandatory on arduino-esp32 3.x, where lwIP core-locking
asserts on a raw call from any task but `tcpip_thread` (see docs/BUGS.md); keeping raw
lwIP out of the app and worker tasks is the one thing this layer exists to enforce.

## RX path - one owner for the window and the drain

Inbound:

```
tcpip_thread: recv_cb  -->  copy into TcpConn.rx_buffer (advance rx_head)  -->  post EVT_DATA
worker:       server_tick -> dispatch_event -> on_data  -->  drain the ring (advance rx_tail)
```

**Receive-window flow control: now single-owner (transport).** `recv_cb` no longer
ACKs on copy. The worker calls `Tcp.conn->ack_consumed(slot)` once per slot per loop
and transport reopens the TCP window by exactly the bytes drained since the last ACK
(ack-on-consume; `tcp_recved` marshaled). The window therefore tracks ring occupancy
and a slow consumer cannot overflow the ring. **TCP-level requirement:**
`RX_BUF_SIZE >= TCP_WND` (you cannot advertise a window larger than your buffer).
See docs/BUGS.md "RX flow-control deadlock".

**RX ring read API: now single-owner (transport).** Consumers no longer index
`rx_buffer` or advance `rx_tail`. They drain through the transport read API -
`pc_conn_available` / `pc_conn_read_byte` / `pc_conn_read` / `pc_conn_peek` /
`pc_conn_consume` (inline in tcp.h, single-consumer per slot). Migrated:
`presentation.cpp` (HTTP), `websocket.cpp`, `telnet.cpp`, `ssh/ssh_conn.cpp`,
`tls/tls.cpp`, and the conn_pool-ring services `modbus.cpp` / `opcua.cpp` (their
duplicated `ring_peek/consume/avail` are now thin adapters over the API). The read
functions only consume; the window is reopened by the worker's single
`Tcp.conn->ack_consumed()` per loop - so there is exactly one place that touches the
ring indices for draining and one that ACKs.

## Outbound clients - the unified client transport (pc_client)

The device's clients (`http_client`, `mqtt`, `ws_client`) do not each own a raw lwIP
stack: they share **`pc_client`** (`network_drivers/transport/pc_client.*`), the
client-side peer of the server transport. It is a small fixed pool of outbound
connections with the same rules - every raw `tcp_*()` marshaled to tcpip_thread, a
per-connection wire ring, and **ack-on-consume** (`Tcp.client->read()` reopens the
window as the caller drains; `PC_CLIENT_RX_BUF >= TCP_WND`), so client and server
share one flow-control model. TLS clients layer `pc_tls_client_session_*` on top, pointing
the BIO at `Tcp.client->send` / `Tcp.client->read` (the ring carries ciphertext).

The `s_rx` ring inside `mqtt.cpp` / `ws_client.cpp` is a separate **plaintext frame
buffer** (post-decrypt for TLS, the assembly buffer the protocol parser reads),
owned solely by that module - the client mirror of the server's `http body[]` vs the
`conn_pool` wire ring. Not cross-layer, correct as-is.

Both transports use ONE shared primitive for the whole ring: `ring.h` (the
`pc_atomic` SPSC index wrapper + the drain math `pc_ring_available / read_byte /
read / peek / consume` AND the fill math `pc_ring_free / pc_ring_write_span`). The
server (`pc_conn_*` + `recv_cb`) and client (`pc_client_*` + `cc_recv`) are thin
wrappers over it, so the ring invariants - wrap, ordering, lossless backpressure -
live in a single place and no layer reimplements them by hand. Both recv callbacks
bulk-memcpy each pbuf span and publish `head` once. The client ring's indices were
`volatile`; they are now `pc_atomic` like the server (correct cross-core
acquire/release ordering).

## Streaming-body hooks - slot-aware

`http_parser_set_stream_hooks(begin, data, abort)` are global singletons
(last-registered-wins, so OTA / upload / WebDAV streaming are still mutually
exclusive per build). All three now take `HttpReq*`, so a sink can keep
per-connection state: WebDAV holds per-slot PUT state (`g_dav_put[MAX_CONNS]`) and
each connection streams to its own file. This fixed the concurrent-PUT clobber
(docs/BUGS.md) - HW: 4 parallel PUTs with distinct payloads, all byte-exact.

## Ownership: current vs target

| Concern              | Owner (target)              | Status                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Socket TX            | transport `pc_conn_*`       | DONE                                              |
| RX receive window    | transport                   | DONE (`Tcp.conn->ack_consumed`, ack-on-consume)   |
| RX ring read/drain   | transport (read API)        | DONE (`pc_conn_read*`; consumers off the ring)    |
| Streaming sink state | per-slot, slot-aware        | DONE (`g_dav_put[MAX_CONNS]`, slot-aware hooks)   |
| Event routing        | session (owner queue)       | DONE                                              |
| Working memory       | mmgr `plain` (per slot)     | DONE (worker resets it per dispatch)              |
| Key material         | mmgr `secure` (per slot)    | DONE (disjoint region; reclaiming wipes)          |
| Byte moves / parsing | mmgr (`mem`, `str`, `swar`) | DONE (one owner per operation)                    |
| Outbound client I/O  | transport (`pc_client`)     | DONE (pooled, ack-on-consume; all clients use it) |

## Straightening plan (phased; each phase host + HW regresses every consumer)

1. **DONE - RX read API in transport** - `pc_conn_available` / `pc_conn_read_byte`
   / `pc_conn_read` / `pc_conn_peek` / `pc_conn_consume` (inline, tcp.h).
2. **DONE - migrate the consumers** - HTTP / websocket / telnet / ssh / tls + the
   conn_pool-ring services (modbus / opcua) all drain through the API; no external
   `rx_tail` modulo remains. The read functions consume only; `Tcp.conn->ack_consumed`
   stays the one place that reopens the window (per loop), so draining and ACKing
   each have exactly one owner. HW: 10/10 50 KB byte-exact, backpressure 0.
3. **DONE - slot-aware streaming hooks** - `HttpStreamDataCb(HttpReq*, ...)` +
   per-slot WebDAV PUT state `g_dav_put[MAX_CONNS]`; fixed the concurrent-PUT bug
   (HW: 4 parallel PUTs, distinct payloads, all byte-exact).
4. **DONE - outbound clients** - all clients (http_client / mqtt / ws_client) share
   `pc_client`, the unified client transport; brought to the same ack-on-consume
   flow control as the server (`PC_CLIENT_RX_BUF >= TCP_WND`). Each module's `s_rx`
   is its own plaintext frame buffer (the client mirror of the server's `body[]`),
   module-owned and correct as-is.

All phases complete: every cross-layer concern (server TX/RX, RX window, RX read,
streaming sink state, events, memory, outbound client I/O) has exactly one owner
behind a clean API, and the server and client ring drain math is a single shared
primitive (`mmgr/ring.h`) - two connection pools, one ring/read core.

## Protocol dispatch (Layer 5) - how every protocol plugs into the core

The data-piping axis above (who owns RX/TX/window/events) is settled. This is the
_other_ axis: how each application protocol attaches to that plumbing. The rule is
the same - one uniform seam - and it is mostly, but not fully, met.

**The seam - `ProtoHandler` (`session/proto_handler.h`).** A connection-oriented (TCP)
protocol is a vtable of four nullable callbacks keyed by `ConnProto`:

```c
struct ProtoHandler { on_accept; on_data; on_close; on_poll; }; // all take a slot index
```

`dispatch_event()` routes each drained `TcpEvt` to `on_{accept,data,close}` by
`conn_pool[slot].proto`; `handle()` calls `on_poll` for each active slot. Every
handler reads its bytes through the transport RX API (`pc_conn_read` copy-out, or
`pc_conn_peek`+`pc_conn_consume` zero-copy - never the ring internals) and writes
through `Tcp.conn->send`/`Tcp.conn->flush`. So Telnet, SSH (+ `PROTO_SSH_RFWD`), Modbus,
and OPC UA are fully homogeneous: each is a module that exposes a `ProtoHandler` and
touches the core only through those two APIs.

**Connectionless (UDP) services** (SNMP, CoAP, DNS, syslog, flow-export) attach through
a _different_ but deliberately separate seam - `Udp.listener->listen(port, handler, arg)`, one
datagram-in/datagram-out callback. This heterogeneity is correct, not a defect: UDP has
no accept/close/slot lifecycle, so folding it into the slot-based `ProtoHandler` table
would be a forced fit. Two transport models, two matched seams.

**The request/response core is protocol(version)-agnostic:** every version decodes into the
shared `HttpReq` and converges on one `match_and_execute` / route / `Handler` (HTTP/1.1,
HTTP/2, and HTTP/3), and the response funnels back through the symmetric **TX seam** - a
per-connection `pc_resp_sink` function pointer (`TcpConn::pc_resp_sink`) that HTTP/2 installs at
ALPN and HTTP/3 at dispatch. `PC::send()` / `send_empty()` call `conn->pc_resp_sink(...)`
when it is set (h2 frames the reply as HEADERS+DATA on the stream; h3 as an HTTP/3 response on
its QUIC stream) and otherwise build the HTTP/1.1 message - so the response methods name no
protocol. It is the RX `ProtoHandler` seam's TX counterpart: request decode and response encode
both sit behind one uniform per-connection seam.

### Homogeneity work (status)

1. **`session.cpp` (L5) is now protocol-agnostic - DONE.** The dispatcher owns only the
   mechanism (register / look up / route / drain) and names no protocol. Each protocol's
   handler lives in its own module and is exposed by a pure accessor
   (`http_proto_handler()` in presentation, `ssh_proto_handler()` in ssh_conn, ...) that
   carries no dependency on the session layer. The single policy file `proto_builtins.cpp`
   maps each built-in to its accessor behind its feature flag; `proto_get()` calls
   `proto_register_builtins()` once, lazily, so the native harness still works before
   `begin()`. Adding a protocol = write its module + one guarded line in `proto_builtins.cpp`
    - never editing the dispatcher. (The SSH remote-forward listener still self-registers from
      its own opt-in `pc_ssh_forward_begin()`.)

2. **The HTTP TLS/h2/ws data-pump moved out of L5 - DONE.** `presentation.cpp` (Layer 6,
   already the HTTP-connection glue) now owns the HTTP `ProtoHandler`: `http_evt_{accept,
data,close}` plus `tls_data` (the TLS handshake pump + ALPN "h2" detection + WebSocket
   upgrade check before the HTTP/1.1 parser). L5 no longer includes TLS / http2 / websocket /
   http_parser.

3. **HTTP's poll now plugs into the uniform `on_poll` seam - DONE.** HTTP's poll (the file/chunk send
   pumps, the WebSocket + SSE drains, the keep-alive re-parse, request dispatch) is instance-bound - it
   dispatches into a `PC`'s routes - so it used to be a large inline block in the worker loop
   guarded by `if (proto != PROTO_HTTP)`. That block is now `PC::http_poll_slot()`, installed
   as the HTTP `ProtoHandler`'s `on_poll` (via `http_proto_set_poll()`, the `on_poll` analogue of the
   `pc_resp_sink` TX seam; the running instance is wired in at the top of `service_once()`). The worker
   dispatch loop now calls `on_poll` uniformly for **every** protocol including HTTP - it names no
   protocol and has no special case. The singleton pollers (ssh, rfwd) gate on `CONN_ACTIVE` inside
   their own `on_poll`, preserving the behavior the loop-level gate used to give them.

4. **The response path is behind a uniform TX seam - DONE.** `send()` / `send_empty()` no longer
   branch on `conn->h2` / `conn->h3`; a self-framing protocol installs a `TcpConn::pc_resp_sink`
   function pointer (h2 at ALPN, h3 at dispatch) and the response methods route through it, so the
   L7 responders name no protocol. This is the TX counterpart of the RX `ProtoHandler` seam; adding
   a self-framing protocol means installing one `pc_resp_sink`, not editing the responders.

5. **TLS is an inline transform inside the HTTP handler**, not a composable wrapper, so only
   HTTP can be TLS-wrapped. Acceptable and inherent (SSH carries its own crypto; Telnet /
   Modbus / OPC UA are plaintext by definition), noted for completeness.

Net: L5 is pure dispatch and every protocol (including HTTP) lives behind the same uniform seam via
its own module - request decode through the `ProtoHandler` seam (accept / data / close / **poll**),
response encode through the `pc_resp_sink` seam. The worker dispatch loop names no protocol and has no
special case: HTTP plugs in exactly like SSH, Telnet, Modbus, or OPC UA. The one remaining inherent
trait is that TLS is an HTTP-only inline transform (item 5). The piping is straight.

## mmgr - the memory manager (`src/mmgr/`)

One module owns every byte the library hands out and every operation that moves one.
Nothing under `src/` declares its own working storage. A caller borrows from a pool,
and the pool is the only thing that knows where the bytes are, how many there are, and
who may reach them.

This is the general rule, seen from memory: **a function that needs a resource requests
it from that resource's owner.** It does not reach past the owner, it does not keep a
private copy, and it does not decide for itself where the bytes live. For memory the
owner is mmgr, the answer is one of exactly two pools, and the request is a call.

```
src/mmgr/
  arena.c/.h      the double-ended allocator, and the worker identity a borrow keys on
  plaintext.c/.h  the plaintext pool accessor (`plain`)
  secure.c/.h     the secret pool accessor (`secure`); reclaiming wipes
  span.h          pc_span / pc_cspan - a byte region that carries its own bound
  bytes.h         the byte verbs: append into a span, take out of a cspan
  endian.h        a fixed width moved between an integer and the bytes at a pointer
  bitio.h         LSB-first bit writer (DEFLATE, ssh zlib)
  rawmemcpy.h     the raw load and store: PROTO_RAW, PROTO_ALIGN, proto_raw_read
  swar.h          lane math - one word treated as its byte lanes, branchless
  protomem.c/.h   the span walks (`mem`): cpy, move, cmp, chr, set, zero
  protostr.c/.h   the bounded-run walks (`str`): len, diff, eq, starts, find, copy, to_*
  membuild.h      pc_sb - bounded no-heap builder into bytes the caller already owns
  frame.c/.h      declarative frame builder: a frame is a static table of typed fields
  float_bits.h    a double read as the three fields it is
  ring.h          the SPSC byte ring, the segment ring, and the slot-mask view
  dma.c/.h        DMA channel ingest / egress (PC_ENABLE_DMA)
```

### Two pools, one mechanism

`pc_arena` is the mechanism and there is exactly one of it: one contiguous region with
two allocators growing toward each other and the free space floating in the middle.

```
[ persistent  --grows up-->        | free |        <--grows down--  scratch ]
  low addr                    (floating boundary)                   high addr
```

The **persistent** end is a first-fit free list - individual free in any order,
adjacent-block coalesce, top-block shrink, and the bytes come back zeroed. The
**scratch** end is a bump with O(1) reset and mark/release savepoints, aligned up to
`PC_ARENA_MAX_ALIGN` (16). Whichever side needs room takes it, and both ends fail
closed (NULL) rather than crossing. `pc_arena_set` chains a DRAM base and a PSRAM
extension: a borrow takes the first region that fits, a free routes to the owning
region by address. No heap, no stdlib, all state in `pc_arena` (no globals), so it is
unit-tested on the host.

`plaintext.c` and `secure.c` are **not** second allocators. Each is an access layer
that instantiates that one mechanism over its own compile-time-sized storage and
decides who may reach it. Nothing outside `src/mmgr/` names `pc_arena`.

|                    | plaintext (`plain`)                        | secure (`secure`)                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| holds              | anything whose bytes are not secret        | key material only                                       |
| hand-out           | uninitialized                              | uninitialized                                           |
| reclaim            | move the offset                            | **wipe, then** move the offset                          |
| who reclaims       | the worker, once per dispatch              | the borrower, at its own mark/release                   |
| long-lived storage | (none - the pool is emptied each dispatch) | `secure.persist_span()`, the end no mark walks          |
| per-slot size      | `PC_PLAINTEXT_ARENA_SIZE`                  | `PC_SECURE_ARENA_SIZE`, derived from the enabled crypto |

The pool is chosen by whether the contents are secret and by nothing else. Lifetime is
not the axis: both pools carry long-lived and ephemeral borrows. A peer's public point,
a ciphertext on its way out, a staging buffer for an outbound frame are plaintext;
putting them in the secure pool only shrinks the room left for real secrets.

### One slot per worker, so a borrow needs no lock

Each pool is cut one arena per slot: one per server worker (`PC_WORKER_COUNT`), plus
the **ghost** at `PC_GHOST_WORKER_SLOT`, which is the library's own. A borrow resolves
its slot from `pc_worker_self()` and never takes one as an argument, so a borrow cannot
cross workers and the bump needs no lock. A caller that is not a server worker clamps
to the ghost rather than to worker 0. Under `PC_DEBUG_CHECKS` each slot records the
first execution context to touch it and asserts on a second, turning a future
cross-core mistake into an immediate visible failure.

That identity lives in `arena.h`, with the thing it indexes: mmgr arbitrates the
memory, so it owns the identity the arbitration keys on. Starting, waking and stopping
those workers is scheduling and stays in `session/worker`.

### Who reclaims what

- **Plaintext: the worker.** `dispatch_event()` calls `pc_plaintext_reset()` before
  handing an event to its protocol handler, so a borrow is valid only until that
  handler returns and a forgotten release cannot accumulate across events. Inside one
  dispatch, `plain.mark()` / `plain.release()` nest.
- **Secure: the borrower, and reclaiming wipes.** `pc_secure_release()` zeroes the
  reclaimed extent **before** the position moves, so the bytes are already zero at the
  instant they become available again - there is no window in which the next borrow is
  handed the previous tenant's key material. The wipe is structural rather than a
  discipline every return path has to remember, which is the form that had already been
  missed on two SSH key-exchange error paths. `pc_secure_wipe()` is the same primitive
  for storage that was never in a pool.
- **Long-lived secrets: the persistent end.** `secure.persist_span(n)` takes the end no
  mark walks, so a credential table or a key schedule bound once at setup survives every
  release and every reset, and comes back zeroed.

### Ownership is an address range

The two pools are disjoint regions, so the owner is recoverable from the pointer alone.
`pc_plaintext_owns()` and `pc_secure_owns()` are one unsigned subtract and compare
against a compile-time extent, with no loop, no per-slot comparison and no
per-allocation metadata, and they are mutually exclusive by construction: a secret can
never be accepted where plaintext is expected, or the reverse. A pointer below the base
wraps to a huge offset and fails the same bound as one past the end, so an overrun
cannot test as still-inside. `slot_of()` answers which slot, so a borrow being handed
back can be asserted to belong to the calling worker.

`high_water()` reports the peak any slot reached - the number to size the arena by.
Each pool's backing storage is named only from its `bind()`, on the allocation path, so
`--gc-sections` reclaims the whole block from firmware that never borrows; that is why
`reset()` must not bind.

### Every TU declares its own worst case

A pool size is not a chosen number. Each translation unit states the worst-case bytes
it borrows in a single call as a `PC_WORK_*` constant in `protocore_config.h`, and the
module that owns the working set proves it where the struct lives:

```c
static_assert(sizeof(ChachapolyWork) <= PC_WORK_CHACHAPOLY, "...");
```

`PC_SECURE_ARENA_SIZE` is then the **sum** of the terms a build actually compiles, each
gated by its feature flag, so a build pays only for the code it has. A sum rather than a
deepest-nest figure: the sum is a strict upper bound however those working sets nest,
where a nest depth is only correct while the call graph stays as it is. It buys
certainty with a little slack.

The consequence is the one that matters: a module whose working set grows past its
declaration **fails the build, naming itself**, instead of exhausting the pool at run
time on a part nobody was watching. These are sizes and not offsets, so nothing couples
one module to another - order is irrelevant and adding a module shifts no one.

### The one memory outside the pools, and how bytes cross it

The RX rings are the exception, and they are the only one: `TcpConn::rx_buffer[]` in
the static `conn_pool`, and the UDP datagram rings. They exist because the producer is
not a worker - `tcpip_thread` fills them - so they cannot be a worker-slot borrow. The
owning worker drains its ring into a pool borrow, and everything from there on is a
pool pointer:

```
tcpip_thread  -->  rx ring (conn_pool / udp)          the only memory outside the pools
worker        -->  drain into a plain or secure borrow
handler       -->  parse, decrypt, build, all in pool bytes
worker (TX)   -->  drain the borrow straight to the wire
```

TX is the mirror: the send functions read out of a plaintext or secure borrow on the
owning worker and write to the wire, so a byte is never staged into a third buffer on
the way out.

### The byte layer

Borrowing and moving live in the same module because both are about memory the library
owns. Every operation below acts on a pool borrow, and each is stated once so a fix
lands in one place and every codec inherits it.

- **`pc_span` / `pc_cspan`** (span.h) carry storage, capacity, the produced length, and
  a sticky overflow flag. `pos` keeps counting past `cap` on overflow, so an undersized
  region reports the capacity it should have had instead of only failing. A failed
  borrow yields `{NULL, 0}`, never a null with a live capacity, so a caller that skips
  `pc_span_ok()` writes nothing rather than dereferencing null. `plain.span()` /
  `secure.span()` are the preferred borrow: one argument sets both fields, so the
  length cannot drift from what was reserved.
- **`mem`** (protomem) walks a span a register word at a time; a source not co-aligned
  with the destination is funneled through two shifts and an OR. `mem.cmp` is not
  constant time - a secret comparison uses `pc_ct_eq` (crypto/ct_eq.h).
- **`str`** (protostr) answers where a bounded run ends and where two part company, one
  word per test, with `ci` folding ASCII case inside the one body. Also the no-stdlib
  number parsing (`to_long` / `to_ulong` / `to_double` / `to_float`).
- **`swar`** is the access layer under both: load a word, test its lanes branchless,
  name the lane that fired. Byte order enters in exactly one place,
  `pc_swar_zero_lane`. Nothing in it walks a buffer or takes a capacity, which is what
  keeps that claim true. The walks built on it are `str` and nothing else:
  `shared_primitives/runops.h` was a second full implementation of the same operations
  and was removed on 2026-08-08 (docs/BUGS.md), with its 44 call sites rewritten onto
  `str`.
- **`rawmemcpy.h`** owns the load itself: `PROTO_RAW` (`aligned(1)` + `may_alias`) for
  an address that carries no guarantee, `proto_al_load` for one the caller has proven,
  and `proto_raw_read` for a span move at any alignment. `PROTO_RAW_WORD` follows
  `PROTO_WORD_BITS` from the board profile, not the build machine's pointer width.
- **`membuild` / `frame`** build into bytes the caller already owns and never allocate.
  `pc_sb` latches `ok` false on the first append that does not fit, so the caller tests
  one flag at the end instead of a return value per call. A frame is a
  `static const pc_field[]` in rodata walked by one engine, so nothing is parsed at
  runtime and no float formatter is linked unless a frame declares a float field.
- **`ring.h`** holds the SPSC drain and fill math both transports share (see the RX
  path above), plus the segment ring and the slot-mask view.

## Multi-vendor portability (ESP / STM / RP / TI ...)

The library is already OSI-layered and the code prefix (`pc_` / `PC_`) is
vendor-neutral, but three layers still bake in ESP silicon: the per-die board
profiles, the crypto accelerator HAL, and the physical (EMAC + PHY + raw-register
/ lwIP glue) layer. The goal is to **move the vendor-neutral majority into common
areas and let the preprocessor pull in exactly one vendor backend per build**, so
adding STM32 (then TI Sitara / CC32xx, RP2350, others) is "add a subdir + wire the
selector", not a fork. We are targeting a broad board matrix; the seams have to be
designed once, correctly, up front.

**Layout - common by default, a thin per-vendor subdir for what is genuinely
silicon-specific:**

```
src/core_setup/board_profiles/
  board_profile.h            # common: derives (vendor, die, sizes) from build macros
  derived_sizing.h           # common (vendor-agnostic)
  esp/ { s3_defaults.h, p4_defaults.h, c6_defaults.h, ... }   # move existing here
  stm/ { stm32h7_defaults.h, ... }
  rp/  { rp2350_defaults.h, ... }
  ti/  { ... }
src/core_setup/hal/                     # the accelerator HAL - it is ONLY a HAL, partitioned by vendor
  esp/ { esp_crypto_hal.h/.cpp }   # move existing here (RSA/MPI direct-register, 7 dies)
  stm/ { stm_crypto_hal.* }        # STM32 PKA / CRYP / HASH, direct-register
  rp/  { ... }                     # RP2350 SHA-256 block etc, else the crypto/ software path
  ti/  { ... }
src/crypto/                  # stays vendor-AGNOSTIC: portable algorithms only, no move. The HW field/modmul
  <chacha20, poly1305, sha*, ed25519, x25519, rsa/bignum>   # win is pulled in via the HAL's PC_RSA_MODMUL_HW
                                                            # capability macro (already how it works today)
src/network_drivers/physical/
  physical.h                 # common PHY/link API
  esp/ { emac + eth_phy + lwIP raw-register glue }             # move existing here
  stm/ { STM32 ETH MAC + PHY }
  rp/  { PIO-eth / CYW43 / native MAC }
  ti/  { ... }
```

**Selector (the one new common seam):** a single `src/core_setup/board_profiles/pc_platform.h`
maps the toolchain's target macro onto two axes and nothing else pulls vendor
detail directly:

- vendor: `PC_VENDOR_ESP` (from `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_*`), `PC_VENDOR_STM` (from
  `STM32*` / CMSIS device), `PC_VENDOR_RP` (`PICO_RP2350` ...), `PC_VENDOR_TI`.
- die/board: the existing `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_*`-style discriminator per vendor.

A **common selector point** then resolves the backend once per layer:
`#if PC_VENDOR_ESP` -> `#include "esp/..."` `#elif PC_VENDOR_STM` -> `stm/...`
else -> the portable software path (this is how `board_profile.h` picks the die
profile). The crypto layer already does the vendor-agnostic thing without a
dispatcher: `crypto/` is portable C, and each TU keys off the HAL's capability
macro (`PC_RSA_MODMUL_HW`) that the selected `core_setup/hal/<vendor>/` backend defines - so
`crypto/` never moves and never names a vendor. Common code sees an API/macro, not
a vendor subdir.

**Principles (carry the ones the ESP crypto HAL already proved):**

- **The HAL API is total.** Every backend maps each op to hardware or to the
  portable software impl in `crypto/`, so a brand-new vendor with no accelerator
  still links and runs from day one; accel is added incrementally.
- **Zero vendor-SDK symbols inside a HAL backend** - direct register access, our
  own `PC_` register map, no `HAL_*` / `esp_*` / vendor struct (the
  `esp_crypto_hal` rule, applied per vendor). STM32 backends poke CRYP/HASH/PKA
  registers directly.
- **Ground-truth-verify every backend** against that vendor's own headers with the
  `static_assert` regmap cross-check (`penetration_testing/rig_firmware/hal_verify` today
  for ESP soc macros; add an STM CMSIS variant), so a map is proven correct even
  for silicon we have no board for, plus an on-device KAT where a board exists.
- **lwIP stays the common L3+ core** _for portability_; only L1/L2 (MAC + PHY) and
  crypto accel are vendor-partitioned, and the datalink/network/transport/session/
  presentation/application layers do not move _structurally_. **Perf exception:** the
  hot data-path bottlenecks get pulled out of lwIP into a direct-register/DMA network
  HAL (see "Network data-path HAL" under Concurrency / performance below); lwIP is
  retained as the portable fallback + cold-path stack, not the fast path.
- **One RTOS seam.** ESP is FreeRTOS; STM/RP may be FreeRTOS or bare-metal. Fold
  the few primitives we use (mutex, critical section, task spawn, the already-
  abstracted `services/clock.h` time) behind a thin `services/pc_rtos` so a
  vendor picks its RTOS without touching callers.
- **MISRA C / AUTOSAR C++ hold across every backend** (global directive) and no
  `stdlib` in `src/`.

**Sub-items (sized):**

- Extract the ESP backends into `esp/` subdirs + add the `pc_platform.h` selector,
  with **zero behavior change on ESP32** (pure move + include rewire, CI-gated). (M)
- Second vendor: **STM32** board profile + STM crypto HAL (PKA/CRYP/HASH) +
  STM ETH MAC/PHY physical backend, each ground-truth-verified vs CMSIS + KAT'd on
  a Nucleo/Disco once a board is on the bench. (L)
- RP2350 and TI backends as boards arrive; software-fallback crypto makes them
  bootable before any accel exists. (L each)

**Rename - drop "esp" from the name (`DeterministicAsyncWebServer`).** The code
prefix `pc_`/`PC_` is _already_ vendor-neutral ("Deterministic Web Server"), so
this is a product/library-name + docs change, not a code-wide symbol churn. It
touches the repo/library display name (`library.json` / `library.properties`),
README, and the doc prose that says "ESP" where it now means "any target". Do it
alongside the STM32 backend landing (a real second vendor), not before, so the
name stops being aspirational the moment it changes. (S, coordinated)

### PC polling-mode HW modexp - CRT RSA / DH on our own HAL (L, perf + portability)

Found while benching the connected rigs (2026-07-26). Big-integer modexp (DH-2048,
RSA sign/verify) already routes through mbedtls with `CONFIG_MBEDTLS_HARDWARE_MPI=y`
on every die - there is **no software fallback being wrongly taken** on firmware.
But the mbedtls path uses `CONFIG_MBEDTLS_MPI_USE_INTERRUPT=y`: it blocks on the
RSA-done interrupt for **every** modular multiply, and that per-op round-trip, not
the accelerator, dominates. Evidence: our own polling-mode HAL `fe_mul` (single-shot
`pc_rsa_modmul`) is comparable across dies (S3 1403 / P4 1896 / C6 1695 cyc for a
256-bit MODMULT), yet mbedtls's 2048-bit DH modexp spreads ~7.5x (P4 ~20.7k cyc per
2048-bit modmul vs a raw modmul that should cost only a few thousand). The overhead
is the interrupt/driver layer, not the silicon.

**Opportunity:** build a PC modexp on top of the crypto HAL's polling `pc_rsa_modmul`
(Montgomery, CRT for RSA sign, constant-time exponent handling) so RSA/DH run at the
accelerator's real throughput instead of interrupt-round-trip-bound. This is _also_ a
portability win: it gives the library a **vendor-agnostic HW modexp** (the same HAL
API the STM PKA / others implement), so RSA/DH stop depending on each vendor's mbedtls
port. **Tradeoff to measure, not assume** (run the experiment): polling busy-waits the
worker for the modexp duration where interrupt mode yields; for the deterministic
single-owner model a bounded ~tens-of-ms blocking op is likely fine, but confirm
against `PC_WORKER_COUNT` scheduling before switching the default. Keep mbedtls as
the fallback where the HAL has no MODMULT (classic ESP32) or where a die's interrupt
path already wins (measure C6). Legacy finite-field DH is lower-priority than RSA sign;
modern KEX is curve25519/ECDH already.

### Network data-path HAL - replace lwIP hot paths with direct MAC/DMA register calls (L, perf + portability)

Raised 2026-07-27. lwIP is a fine portable reference stack but it is slow in the
places that matter for a deterministic single-owner server, and several of its costs
are structural, not tunable. Mirror what the crypto HAL did (`src/hal`: direct
registers, our own `PC_` register map, **zero** `soc/` / vendor symbols, ground-truth
`static_assert`-verified vs the vendor headers): pull the networking **data path** out
of lwIP into a direct-register/DMA HAL under `network_drivers/physical/<vendor>/`, and
keep lwIP only as the portable fallback / cold-path L3+ where throughput does not
matter.

**lwIP pain points (measure each, fix the ones that pay):**

- **pbuf churn + copies** - RX/TX bounce through pbuf pools with per-segment copies; a
  zero-copy DMA-descriptor ring (own the EMAC / WiFi RX/TX descriptors) removes both
  the copy and the pool-exhaustion stalls.
- **`tcpip_thread` marshaling** - every socket/PCB call is marshaled onto the single
  tcpip task via `tcpip_api_call` (our transport layer already pays this - real per-op
  overhead + a serialization point); a direct datapath skips the trip.
- **TIME_WAIT PCB memory** - each closed active connection parks a ~224 B `tcp_pcb` in
  TIME_WAIT for ~1 min (observed 2026-07-27 on the SMB rig: free heap dipped exactly
  one PCB per rapid outbound probe, then recovered on expiry). A lean connection table
  with our own reuse policy reclaims it immediately for the trusted deterministic case.
- **stacked socket / netconn / raw-PCB APIs** - three layers each add copies/locks; the
  hot path can target the raw PCB or below.
- **coarse timers + conservative window/retransmit logic** - leave throughput on the
  table on a fast local link.

**Opportunity:** a `pc_net` datapath HAL (RX/TX descriptor rings + a minimal,
deterministic TCP fast-path) that runs the common case at wire/DMA speed, with lwIP
retained for ARP/ICMP/DHCP/edge cases and as the portability floor for a new vendor
before its HAL exists. Same shape as the crypto HAL: vendor-agnostic API, per-die
register backends, ground-truth verified vs the vendor headers.

**Tradeoffs to measure, not assume** (run the experiment): a hand-rolled TCP fast-path
must stay RFC-correct - re-verify interop against real peers, not just self-consistency
(a self-consistent stack test proves only self-consistency). Scope per pain point; land
the zero-copy DMA ring + TIME_WAIT reclaim first (highest value, lowest correctness
risk), and defer a full TCP fast-path until measured. Keep every change behind the
`network_drivers/physical/<vendor>/` seam so lwIP-only vendors still boot.

## Architecture-agnostic core - decisions of 2026-07-29

The multi-vendor section above describes _where_ silicon-specific code goes. This section records the
harder questions that surfaced once we started actually going wide, and what was decided. Targets:
**Xtensa, RISC-V, Arm, TI C2000**.

### The problems we are actually solving

**1. `uint8_t` is not an octet.** This is the deepest portability problem in the library and it is not a
naming issue. TI C28x has no 8-bit addressable memory: `CHAR_BIT == 16`, so `uint8_t` is 16 bits wide and
`sizeof` counts 16-bit words. ProtoCore is essentially one large wire-protocol byte machine - every
`uint8_t buf[]`, every `memcpy` into a frame, every length in octets, every crypto block, every `sizeof`
used as a wire length. An array of 100 `uint8_t` is 100 sixteen-bit words there, and a 1500-byte frame does
not lay out the way the code assumes. C-versus-C++ is a footnote next to this.

**2. Control law is reviewed as C.** On C2000 parts the control-law code is written and reviewed as C.
An API that requires a C++ compiler to call is unusable exactly where the library most needs to be usable.

**3. Vendor idioms leak upward.** The ESP-IDF component build currently hard-requires `arduino-esp32`
because the core calls Arduino APIs (`WiFi`, `ESP`, `millis`, `Serial`). Every such call is a porting
blocker for every other architecture.

**4. Guarantees have to survive a compiler.** "Deterministic" and "constant-time" are claims about emitted
instructions. Asserting them in a comment does not make them survive a toolchain upgrade.

### What was decided

**The API is C-shaped; the implementation stays C++.** Flat `pc_` / `PC_` names at global scope, no
namespace, so a C caller can reach everything (see [SYMBOLS.md](SYMBOLS.md) for the full naming law and the
designs rejected). The C++ objection for control law is about the behavior of the emitted binary, and that
is established directly at the instruction level rather than inferred from the source language - so the
implementation language is an implementation detail. Rewriting the implementation in C was considered and
rejected as unnecessary churn.

**One octet abstraction, packed everywhere.**

```
pc_octet_ptr   // byte-addressable targets: a plain uint8_t*, the macros compile to nothing
               // C28x:                     word address + lane selector, asm accessors
```

A native C28x pointer cannot name an octet, but a house-defined one can. Zero cost on Xtensa / RISC-V /
Arm, where the whole abstraction vanishes at compile time. The unpacked one-octet-per-word variant (2x RAM)
was considered and **dropped** - it is not needed, because the cost of packing is not pervasive:

- **Constant offsets** (`hdr[3]`, fixed-layout header and framing codecs - most of the wire code): the lane
  is a compile-time constant, the mask and shift fold away, and it becomes a word load plus an immediate
  AND. Melts entirely.
- **Sequential runtime offsets** (payload copy, hash, checksum): the loop strip-mines to word-at-a-time and
  the lane selector leaves the inner loop. Often _faster_ than byte-at-a-time on a byte-addressable machine,
  because 16 bits move per access.
- **TLV and variable-length parsing**: the only runtime quantity is the record base. Field offsets within a
  record are fixed by the protocol grammar and already exist as compile-time constants, so an access is
  `base + CONSTANT`, not `octet[runtime]`. That leaves one bit of uncertainty per record, removable by
  requiring word-aligned record bases or dispatching on base parity once at record entry.

Still to pin: which lane is octet 0 (must be invariant across targets, **not** the machine's word
endianness, or the same frame serializes differently per platform); the unwrap-to-native operation for
DMA/MAC handoff and its alignment precondition; and the fact that `sizeof` stops being a wire length, so
octet-count expressions must replace it - which is mechanically checkable.

**No vendor language or idioms in the core.** Vendor registers reach the library only through a HAL that
auto-configures per **variant capability**, never through a chip check. This extends the pattern already
shipped in `core_setup/hal/` (direct registers, house-owned register map, zero vendor symbols) to every
subsystem, and it is what has to happen before the build system can stop depending on `arduino-esp32`.

**Guarantees are proven at the binary.** Where the library promises a behavior, the promise is checked
against emitted instructions and documented as claim -> disassembly -> why. The claims that get this
treatment: constant-time crypto (no branch or memory access depends on a secret), no-heap-after-`begin()`
(no allocator reachable in the relevant `.text`), and bounded ISR / critical-section paths (a counted worst
case, not an estimate). The octet abstraction earns a fourth once it lands: that it compiles away on
byte-addressable targets and strip-mines to word moves on C28x. Measured, not asserted.
