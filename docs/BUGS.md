# Bug log

A running record of every bug found in this library: what broke, the root cause,
the fix, and status. Newest first. A bug is logged here the moment it is found
(even before it is fixed) so nothing slips.

Status key: **OPEN** (found, not fixed) - **FIXED** (fixed, validated) - **SHIPPED** (released).

## Audit F3 "a framing failure permanently wedges the channel" - OVERSTATED, the idle sweep reclaims it

- **Status:** CLOSED 2026-08-09 as not the defect it was filed as. The leak is real; the consequence
  is not. Filed so the severity is not acted on twice.
- **The leak, confirmed:** `pc_ssh_conn_open_forwarded` (`ssh_conn.c:271`) releases the secure mark
  and returns -1 when `ssh_pkt_send` fails, while the channel `pc_ssh_channel_open_forwarded`
  allocated at `:263` stays `pending`. `chan_alloc` skips any slot with `open || pending`, so with
  the default `PC_SSH_MAX_CHANNELS == 1` no further channel opens on that connection.
- **The claim that does not hold:** F3 calls it "unrecoverable short of a reconnect", which reads as
  a permanent wedge. The reconnect is automatic and bounded. `tcp_conn.c:443` arms the connection
  pool's idle sweep at `CONN_TIMEOUT_MS` (5000 ms, `protocore_config.h:220`); `ssh_conn.c:133` binds
  `.on_close = pc_ssh_conn_close`, so the sweep frees the SSH slot; and `pc_ssh_conn_accept` calls
  `pc_ssh_channel_init` (`:357`), which clears the slot's channels for the next tenant. A wedged
  channel therefore costs at most one idle timeout.
- **What it actually is:** up to 5 s during which an `ssh -R` accept on that connection returns -1
  and `rfwd_on_accept` closes the inbound socket. Worth tidying, not worth an API.
- **Not fixed, deliberately:** releasing the slot on that path needs a counterpart to `chan_alloc`
  that does not exist - the two handlers that clear `pending` both parse a peer message, and here
  the CHANNEL_OPEN never reached the wire. Adding a public release for a 5 s self-healing window is
  not worth the surface.

## The SSH plaintext draw is undeclared, and with zlib on the nest is over the arena

- **Status:** OPEN, from the `network_drivers/presentation` resource audit (F8). The orphan term and
  the missing assert are **verified**; the 8,760 B peak is the audit's arithmetic and is **not**
  confirmed by a run, because nothing can run it (below).
- **Verified here:** `PC_PLAINTEXT_WORK_SSH_TRANSPORT` is defined twice in `ssh_packet.h:204,206`
  (zlib and non-zlib arms) and referenced nowhere else in `src/`. Nothing asserts it against
  `PC_PLAINTEXT_ARENA_SIZE`, which is 8192 (`protocore_config.h:6477`). Every other
  `PC_PLAINTEXT_WORK_*` in the tree carries that assert in its owning `.c`.
- **The audit's arithmetic**, from the nest it read: `ssh_recv_ctr_emac` holds
  `SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE + 64` = 2,112 across `ssh_dispatch_payload`, which holds `SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE` =
  2,048 (zlib only) across `pc_ssh_server_dispatch`, which holds a 2,048 reply span across the whole
  switch, under which `pc_ssh_auth_handle_pubkey` holds 368 + 2,120 + 64 = 2,552.
    - `PC_ENABLE_SSH_ZLIB=0`: 2112 + 2048 + 2552 = **6,712** of 8,192. Fits.
    - `PC_ENABLE_SSH_ZLIB=1`: + 2,048 = **8,760**. Over by 568, and `pc_ssh_auth_handle_pubkey`
      fails closed to USERAUTH_FAILURE - correct behaviour, silently denying every valid key.
- **Why it is not confirmed, and cannot be as the matrix stands:** no env builds SSH auth with
  compression. `native_ssh` carries the auth suites but its src list has no `ssh_comp.c`, so
  `-DPC_ENABLE_SSH_ZLIB=1` on it fails to link (`ssh_comp_s2c_active`, `ssh_comp_on_auth_success`
  and four more undefined). `native_ssh_comp` and `native_ssh_zlib` build the compressor but run no
  auth. The combination that would fail is the one combination nothing covers.
- **The decision, not written:** either raise `PC_PLAINTEXT_ARENA_SIZE` past the real nest, or add
  the `static_assert` the orphan term implies and let a zlib build fail at compile time instead of
  at run time. The assert is the one that makes the budget checkable, and it will not pass today -
  which is the point. Both are sizing calls, and an env that builds auth against the compressor is
  wanted either way.

## A refused SSH send leaves the sequence number and the cipher ahead of the peer, and the session dies

- **Status:** OPEN for the desync. The reporting half is FIXED in `cd435b1b6`; this entry is the part
  that fix does not reach. Found in the `network_drivers/presentation` resource audit (F2).
- **What is fixed:** `pc_ssh_conn_send` discarded the `Tcp.conn->send` return and returned `len`
  regardless, so a short send window read to the caller as a complete write. It now returns -1.
- **What is not:** by the time that send runs, `ssh_pkt_send` has already done `s->seq_no_send++`
  (`ssh_packet.c:372`) and advanced the AEAD invocation counter (`:352`). A refused queue therefore
  leaves this end's send side one packet ahead of the peer's receive side, and **every subsequent
  packet fails the peer's MAC**. Returning -1 tells the caller the write failed; it does not undo
  the cipher step, and nothing retries the framed bytes. The session is unrecoverable from that
  point whether or not the caller notices.
- **Reach:** `pc_ssh_conn_send` is the port-forward data path (`ssh_forward.c:211`, `:521`), which is
  exactly where sustained load fills a send buffer. `ssh_scp.c:88,93` and `ssh_sftp.c:170` discard
  the return entirely, so those two do not even learn.
- **Resolved shape (maintainer, 2026-08-09):** retrying is the wrong answer. A refused queue means
  the peer is gone, and a peer that is gone sends nothing further, so there is no session left to
  keep in step with - the desync is only a problem for a session that continues. The connection is
  torn down instead of preserving cipher state for a peer that will never read it. That leaves the
  fix as propagating the failure to a teardown, not as a retry queue, and unties this finding from
  F1's borrow-placement question.
- **Still to write:** the teardown itself. `pc_ssh_conn_send` now returns -1; `ssh_scp.c:88,93` and
  `ssh_sftp.c:170` still discard that, so they neither learn nor close.

## The server's SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS is framed into an occupied slot and dropped, and the test cannot see it

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`ssh_packet.c` `ssh_pkt_emit`). Confirmed by reading the whole path,
  found in the `network_drivers/presentation` resource audit (F1). **Not reproduced on hardware yet** - that is the
  next step, and the audit says the same.
- **Symptom (by construction, not observed):** the server answers `SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT` with two
  packets and only the first reaches the wire.
- **The path, every hop read:**
    1. `ssh_server.c:138` `emit(i, reply.buf, n)` - KEXDH_REPLY.
    2. `ssh_server.c:141` `emit(i, &newkeys, 1)` - NEWKEYS, immediately after, nothing between.
    3. `emit()` (`ssh_server.c:34`) is `static inline void` and calls `s_srv.emit_cb`, discarding
       any result.
    4. `emit_cb` is bound to `ssh_emit` at `ssh_conn.c:124`.
    5. `ssh_emit` (`ssh_conn.c:78`) calls `ssh_pkt_emit`, and on 0 calls `Workers.wake`.
    6. `ssh_pkt_emit` (`ssh_packet.c:157-160`) opens with
       `if (s->tx_ready) { return -1; } // one packet in flight per slot`.
       The first emit sets `tx_ready` (`:176`). The second therefore returns -1 and the payload is never
       framed. `emit()` returns `void`, so nothing upstream learns of it, and `ssh_newkeys_sent(i)` on the
       very next line turns `enc_out` on regardless.
- **Nothing drains in between.** `Workers.wake` -> `pc_worker_wake` (`worker.c`) is
  `pc_platform_task_notify` - it signals a task, it does not run one. The only drain is
  `ssh_tx_drain`, called at `ssh_conn.c:419`, _after_ `ssh_pkt_recv` at `:414` has returned, and at
  `:316` on a later poll.
- **Consequence:** the peer never sees NEWKEYS, so it never switches its inbound cipher, while the
  server encrypts from the next packet on. Every subsequent server packet arrives encrypted into a
  plaintext parser. The handshake stalls and the client is dropped on the idle timeout. The same
  double-emit shape sends `CHANNEL_EOF` + `CHANNEL_CLOSE` at `ssh_server.c:356-360`, where the second
  is likewise dropped and the peer keeps a half-open channel.
- **Why the suite is green:** `test_ssh_server.c:186-190` asserts exactly this - `emt_n == 2`,
  `emt_type[0] == KEXDH_REPLY`, `emt_type[1] == NEWKEYS` - and passes. It installs its own callback
  through `pc_ssh_server_set_emit_cb`, so it proves `pc_ssh_server_dispatch` _calls_ emit twice and
  never exercises `ssh_emit` or `ssh_pkt_emit`. The one-packet-per-slot rule is on the other side of
  the seam the test replaces. No native env covers the real emit path.
- **Fix:** the wire holds two packets (`SSH_WIRE_CAP = 2 * SSH_PKT_WIRE_MAX`), and `ssh_pkt_emit`
  appends the second at `tx_len` instead of returning -1 when `tx_ready`. SSH streams binary packets
  back-to-back (RFC 4253 sec 6), so KEXDH_REPLY + NEWKEYS and CHANNEL_EOF + CHANNEL_CLOSE frame into
  `tx_wire` in sequence and leave on one drain; `ssh_pkt_send` bumps `seq_no_send` per call so the pair
  carries consecutive sequence numbers, and the `enc_out` flip after NEWKEYS keeps both under one state.
  The `ssh_conn.c` static_assert proves the doubled wire fits (needs 10644, budget 12992).
  Verified: `native_ssh` + `native_ssh_conn`, 268/268.

## native_coaps_server: eight CID-routing tests fail, and they failed before the crypto cascade

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-09 while verifying the crypto-ownership cascade. **Pre-existing** -
  reproduced identically at `0c8fa67db`, the commit before the cascade, in a clean worktree with
  only the `mmgr` link deps added. Same eight tests, same counts. Nothing in the cascade touches it.
- **Symptom:** 8 of 20 fail, every one on connection-ID routing or address migration:
    - `:458` `test_server_single_peer` - `pc_coaps_server_ingest` refuses the first application
      record, though the handshake completed and `pc_coaps_server_active_conns()` is 1.
    - `:478` `test_two_peers_routing`, `:551` `test_cid_address_migration`,
      `:766` `test_unknown_cid_dropped`, `:800` `test_slot_lookup_same_port_different_ip`,
      `:832` `test_slot_by_cid_skips_and_bounds`, `:862` `test_cid_no_migration_when_address_unchanged`,
      `:883` `test_cid_migration_same_port_different_ip`.
      The slot-lifecycle tests around them all pass (`test_ingest_ring_full`, `test_pool_full_rejects_new_peer`,
      `test_fatal_handshake_frees_slot`, `test_pto_ceiling_frees_slot`), so the pool works and the
      lookup path is what does not.
- **Not a crash.** pio reports `SIGFPE`, which is Unity's exit code - it exits with the failure count,
  and 8 renders as signal 8. Under gdb the program runs to completion with no fault and no stack.
  The same artifact renders 5 failures as `SIGTRAP` and 1 as `SIGHUP` elsewhere in the suite.
- **Root cause:** not investigated. `PC_COAPS_MAX_CONNS` (2) and `PC_COAPS_INGEST_RING` (6) are sane
  in `coaps_server.h:42,45`, so the ring arithmetic at `coaps_server.c:176,198` is not at fault.
- **Fix:** not written.

## Audit F1/F2 "the PQC stack overflows an ESP32 worker by 3-5x" - NOT A BUG, the floors are enforced

- **Status:** CLOSED 2026-08-09 as not-a-bug, on the severity claim. Filed so the claim is not acted
  on twice.
- **The claim:** `crypto.md` F1 and F2 measure sntrup761 decapsulation at ~23 KB of frame and
  ML-KEM-768 decapsulation at ~9 KB, then rate both category C on the grounds that "a FreeRTOS worker
  task on an ESP32 is typically stacked at 4-8 KB, so the SSH KEX path overflows by 3-5x".
- **Why it does not hold:** the 4-8 KB is a generic FreeRTOS default, not this library's. The worker
  stack is sized per feature combination in `protocore_config.h:306-332`, and the numbers there are
  the same ones the audit measured:
    - sntrup761 + reverse-SSH client: 40960
    - sntrup761, server only: 32768
    - ML-KEM only (sntrup761 explicitly off): 16384
    - SSH without PQC: 12288; no SSH: 8192
      The block's own comment states "the reverse-SSH CLIENT runs KeyGen+Decaps whose FO re-encrypt
      peaks ~32 KB, the SERVER runs Encaps only (~22 KB)".
- **And it is enforced, not merely defaulted:** four `#error` guards fail the build when the stack is
  set by hand below the floor - `:7053` (RSA/OIDC), `:7062` (curve25519/ed25519), `:7074` (ML-KEM),
  `:7093` (sntrup761, naming 32768 server / 40960 client). A build that starves the KEX does not
  link, it stops at the preprocessor with the number it needs.
- **What survives from F1/F2:** two smaller points, neither category C. The scratch is
  function-scope, so it rides the SRCBANNED #19 ratchet like the other 984 sites. And the frames are
  abandoned unwiped - `f`/`ginv` (the sntrup761 private key), `r`, and ML-KEM's `shat`/`mprime` -
  which is the same exposure as F7 and belongs with it, not with a stack-overflow finding.
- **Lesson for the next audit read:** the figures were right and the consequence was wrong. The
  audit did not read `PC_WORKER_TASK_STACK`.

## The hash context became a view, so every copy of one silently aliased its source

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 across `2f6875793`, `66c2a024a` and the dtls_conn helper commit.
  Found by the native suite; the shape was proved with a worktree at the pre-cascade commit.
- **Symptom:** the DTLS and QUIC suites disagreed with the server on the Finished MAC
  (`test_dtls_conn.c:441`, five tests), `native_coaps_server` took a SIGBUS, and the h3 / quic
  servers failed to complete a handshake.
- **Root cause:** the ownership cascade turned `pc_sha256_ctx` / `pc_sha512_ctx` into views - `rx`,
  `tx` and `fs` point into the caller's working bytes. Anything that duplicated or shared those
  bytes therefore aliased a live hash instead of snapshotting it. It surfaced three ways, and the
  first two look nothing alike:
    1. **Struct assignment.** `pc_sha256_ctx b = a;` was a snapshot when the context owned its
       storage. 19 sites finalized the copy and destroyed the running transcript.
    2. **By-value parameter.** `complete_handshake_from_flight(DtlsConn *, pc_sha256_ctx tr, ...)`
       is the same copy in argument form, which a search for `ctx X = Y;` does not find.
    3. **One shared work buffer.** The test conversion gave each TU a single `tw[4096]` and passed
       it to every entry point. A context keeps working out of the bytes it was initialized with,
       so a one-shot taking the same buffer overwrote it mid-life: the `pc_ed25519_verify` between
       CertificateVerify and Finished clobbered the transcript.
- **Why the library was never exposed:** `src/` holds every context in its owner and passes it by
  pointer. A sweep for all three forms across `src/` returns nothing. The hazard was real but only
  the tests tripped it.
- **Fix:** the copies are gone - `final()` compresses into a state copy and leaves the context
  running, so the snapshot they existed for is unnecessary. 23 test contexts take their own storage,
  and the one by-value helper rebinds onto its own span. Both context headers now state that the
  three pointers are the caller's and a struct copy aliases them.
- **Nothing caught it:** the aliasing is invisible to the compiler - the copy is well-formed C - and
  undefined behaviour made it luck-dependent, so `native_quic_tls` and `native_coaps` passed on the
  same bug that made `native_tls13_kdf` derive a wrong master secret.

## The HkdfLabel scratch reserves 514 bytes for a 51-byte worst case, and the clamp is why

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 in the `src/` resource audit (`crypto.md` F11). The ban-19 half
  is closed - the buffer moved out of function scope into the caller's borrow - and this is the
  remainder. Needs a contract decision, not a patch.
- **Symptom:** `crypto/kdf/hkdf.c:21` sets `HKDF_INFO_CAP` to `(2 + 1 + 255 + 1 + 255)` = 514, and
  every consumer's `PC_HKDF_BORROW` carries it. The file's own comment at `:71-73` bounds what this
  tree actually produces: the longest label is `tls13 client in` (15) and the context is a
  Transcript-Hash (<= 32) or empty, so 2 + 1 + 15 + 1 + 32 = **51 bytes** of the 514 are ever used.
- **Why it is not just a smaller number:** the 514 is not arbitrary, it matches the clamp.
  `:78-79` reads `strnlen(label_prefix, 255)` and `strnlen(label, 255 - prefix_len)`, so a caller
  that passed a long label would legitimately fill the buffer. Shrinking the buffer without
  shrinking the clamp turns an over-reservation into an overflow. The two move together or not at
  all.
- **The decision:** `TUNING.md:100` says a pool size is the TU's precomputed worst case, not a
  chosen number - which argues for sizing to this tree's real callers and clamping to match. Against
  that, `pc_hkdf_expand_label_ctx` is written as a protocol-general RFC 8446 sec 7.1 primitive whose
  label is `opaque<7..255>`, and narrowing the clamp narrows what it accepts. Roughly 460 bytes per
  consumer borrow ride on the answer.

## Five crypto TUs carry PC_CRYPTO_HOT against crypto_opt.h's own prohibition, and its own bench numbers

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 in the `src/` resource audit (`crypto.md` F19). Needs a decision,
  not a patch: the two halves of `crypto_opt.h` disagree and only the maintainer can pick.
- **Symptom:** `crypto_opt.h:40-46` caveat 1 says to apply `PC_CRYPTO_HOT` ONLY to code that is
  constant-time by structure, and "Do NOT put it on scalar-multiplication / bignum / point-arithmetic
  code that relies on branchless mask-selects". All five TUs that carry it are those categories:
    - `crypto/asymmetric/bignum.c:32` and `rsa.c:25` - bignum.
    - `crypto/asymmetric/curve25519.c:31` - a Montgomery ladder resting on `pc_gf_cswap:305`.
    - `crypto/asymmetric/ed25519.c:32` - point arithmetic resting on `ed_cswap:457`.
    - `crypto/asymmetric/ecdsa.c:74,76` - point arithmetic resting on `pt_table_select:666`, and it
      takes the stronger `PC_CRYPTO_HOT_PEEL` on the S3.
- **Why this is not a straight removal:** the caveat argues those paths are accelerator-dominated so
  the `-O` level "buys them almost nothing - all risk, no reward". The same header's measured
  per-die defaults (`:69-74`) contradict that for two of them: on the P4, x25519 is 6.8% and ed25519
  4.5% faster at `-O3`, and `:54` records that the S3's Ed25519 sign is 1.2% SLOWER at `-O3`. So
  these TUs were benched, and the pragma on at least curve25519/ed25519 buys a measured win.
- **The exposure, stated honestly:** `#pragma GCC optimize` applies to the whole TU, and the
  documented risk is if-conversion running backwards on a mask-select, turning
  `dst->X[i] |= table[e].X[i] & mask;` into a branch on a secret index. Nobody has disassembled to
  show it happens here. `SRC_LAW.md`'s "Guarantees are proven at the binary" requires exactly that
  chain for a constant-time claim, and the chain does not exist for these five either way.
- **What would settle it:** disassemble the five mask-select sites at the level each TU actually
  builds at and check no branch depends on a secret. That decides it on evidence instead of on which
  half of the header is believed. Until then the choice is the maintainer's: keep the measured speed,
  or drop the pragma on the three point/bignum TUs and take the loss.

## Six SSH sites read a slot's crypto bytes before the slot was bound, so the first host-key set faulted

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 in `145c3b925`, found by the native suite (`native_ssh_pqc`).
- **Symptom:** `pc_ssh_hostkey_ed25519_set()` segfaulted. gdb put it in `pc_sha512_update` with the
  key pointer at address 0, three frames under `pc_ed25519_pubkey`.
- **Root cause:** the crypto-ownership cascade moved every hash and signature onto caller-supplied
  working bytes, and the SSH sites take theirs from `ssh_pkt[i].crypto_work`. That member is null
  until `ssh_pkt_slot_storage()` binds it, and `cli_crypto_work()` returns null when the pool cannot
  cover the slot. Six sites read it without either:
    - `transport/ssh_transport.c:117` - `pc_ssh_hostkey_ed25519_set`, the one that faulted.
    - `transport/ssh_transport.c:1011` - the Ed25519 arm of `sign_hash`; the ECDSA and RSA arms
      beside it were already guarded.
    - `connection/ssh_client.c` x4 - `cli_crypto_work()` passed straight in as an argument, so the
      null check inside it bought the caller nothing.
- **Worst consequence:** a null write and a null read inside key derivation, on the first host-key
  set of a server that has one configured. Not reachable from the wire; reachable from `begin()`.
- **Fix:** each site binds the slot first or fails closed. `hybrid_sntrup761_x25519` also reached
  back into the slot for its SHA-512 instead of using the `work` it was handed; it uses the
  parameter now.
- **Nothing caught it:** no host env compiled the SSH transport with a bound pool before this run.

## test_coaps asserted a length guard that had moved out of the AEAD, and smashed the stack proving it

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 in `f7bc5d0dc`, found by the native suite (`native_coaps`).
- **Symptom:** `test_quic_aead_open_rejects_short_ciphertext` segfaulted.
- **Root cause:** the test passed `uint8_t key[16]` where `pc_aes128gcm_open()` takes
  `struct pc_aes128gcm_key *`, and passed a null tag. Its comment claimed neither was dereferenced
  because open() rejects a short ciphertext first. That guard was moved out to the callers -
  `quic_crypto.c:139` records the move - so the portable backend now casts the key and calls
  `set_j0()` on its first line, writing past a 16-byte stack array.
- **Fix:** the test is deleted rather than repaired: with the current contract it cannot be written
  at all, since a null tag faults in `pc_ct_eq` even with a valid key context. The guard is covered
  where it now lives, by `test_gcm_open_rejects_short` in `test_quic_crypto`. Every caller of
  `pc_aes128gcm_open` was checked for the length guard first: `quic_crypto.c`, `dtls_record.c` and
  `tls_record.c` all hold it, and `smb2.c` reads its tag from a separate 16-byte copy.

## The mbedtls-backed asymmetric and CCM paths may call the heap at run time

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 in the `src/` resource audit (`crypto.md` F12). **DEFERRED** by
  the maintainer 2026-08-08: not to be chased until someone confirms it against a linked binary.
- **Symptom:** unconfirmed. On the accelerated builds, one X25519 key exchange, one ECDSA sign, one
  RSA verify and every AES-CCM record may each take and release heap, which would break the
  "no heap after `begin()`" guarantee on the configuration the library actually ships.
    - `crypto/asymmetric/curve25519.c:270-285` - `pc_gf_inv` declares four `mbedtls_mpi` and calls
      `mbedtls_mpi_read_binary` / `mbedtls_mpi_exp_mod` / `mbedtls_mpi_write_binary`.
    - `crypto/asymmetric/ecdsa.c:95-118,128-151,160-183,189-212` - the four mbedtls entry points,
      through `mbedtls_ecp_group_load` and `mbedtls_ecp_mul`.
    - `crypto/asymmetric/rsa.c:63-106`.
    - `crypto/aead/aesccm.c:51-52,81-82` - `mbedtls_ccm_setkey` reaches `mbedtls_cipher_setup`.

    The other three mbedtls uses in that tree (`aes256ctr.c:59`, `aes_cmac.c:35`, and the SHA
    backends) take plain context structs and do not allocate.

- **Root cause:** if it holds, `mbedtls_mpi_grow` under `read_binary` is `mbedtls_calloc`,
  `exp_mod` allocates its own sliding-window table, and `cipher_setup`'s `ctx_alloc_func()` is
  `mbedtls_calloc`. Whether any of that is reachable depends on the platform's
  `MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_MEMORY` / `MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_STD_CALLOC` configuration, which this repo does not
  own.
- **Why it is deferred rather than fixed:** the finding is indirect, inferred through a vendor
  library rather than observed. `SRC_LAW.md` requires a guarantee about emitted code to be proven at
  the binary, and that proof does not exist either way here. Confirming it needs the linked `.text`
  checked for a reachable allocator call on a real ESP32 build; the audit that raised it says the
  same about itself. Acting on an unconfirmed vendor-behavior claim would mean rewriting four
  working crypto paths on a guess.
- **What would settle it:** build for `esp32dev`, disassemble the linked image, and check whether
  `mbedtls_calloc` is reachable from `pc_gf_inv`, the four `ecdsa.c` entry points, `rsa.c`'s verify,
  and `mbedtls_ccm_setkey`. Either it is reachable, and this becomes a real SRC_LAW rule-1 violation
  with a known blast radius, or it is not, and the entry is closed as NOT A BUG.

## Six TUs write through an unchecked pool borrow, so exhaustion is a NULL write or a garbage key

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 in the `src/` resource audit. Cross-cutting: every site below is
  filed in its own area report, the class is filed in none.
- **Symptom:** the pools fail closed and these callers fail open.
    - `crypto/mac/hmac_sha256.c:72` returns without setting `ctx->okey`, which is then used.
    - `crypto/rng/rng.c:74` dereferences an unchecked `pc_secure_persist_span()`.
    - `network_drivers/application/smb/smb2.c:917,929,987,998` pass `pc_secure_span(...).buf` with no
      `pc_span_ok()`.
    - `network_drivers/presentation/http/http3/quic_crypto.c:46,50,180` write through `pc_secure_alloc`
      with no NULL test.
    - `services/security/ikev2/ikev2.c:1434,1458` the same, and `sk_message_build:1697` discards the
      seal result on top.
    - `services/system/esp/esp.c:78,113` the same.

    The AEAD backends close the trap: `core_setup/hal/portable/portable_aes128gcm.c:209-213` writes
    through `storage` unconditionally, so a NULL arrives as a store rather than as a check.

- **Root cause:** `mmgr/secure.h:99-105` states the contract - "Returns NULL if the request does not
  fit - callers MUST handle null and fail closed" - and `pc_secure_span()` yields an empty span so an
  omitted `pc_span_ok()` writes nothing rather than dereferencing null. Both are advisory. Nothing in
  the signature forces the check, so six independent TUs skipped it the same way.
- **Worst consequence:** `hmac_sha256.c:72` leaves `ctx->okey` indeterminate and proceeds. Under
  deterministic ECDSA nonce generation that is a nonce-reuse path, and nonce reuse recovers the
  private key. The rest are NULL writes and a reset.
- **Nothing can catch it:** no test drives an arena to exhaustion, so every one of these paths is
  unreachable in the native suite by construction.
- **Fix:** not written. The durable form is to make the check unskippable rather than to add six
  checks - a borrow that cannot be handed to a keyed init without passing `pc_span_ok()` first.

  `network_drivers_application.md`, `network_drivers_http.md`, `services_security_storage.md`,

## `PC_PLAINTEXT_ARENA_SIZE` is a chosen number, not a sum, so concurrent borrows are never proved

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 in the `src/` resource audit. Cross-cutting: the derivation gap
  and the failure it causes are filed in two different area reports and connected in neither.
- **Symptom:** `protocore_config.h:6477` sets `PC_PLAINTEXT_ARENA_SIZE` to 8192. The plaintext work
  terms sum to **15,011 B**. Each module header asserts only that its own term fits the arena alone,
  so no two concurrent borrows are ever proved to coexist. The live consequence: SSH's real nested
  draw is **8,760 B** with `PC_ENABLE_SSH_ZLIB=1`, against the 8,192 B arena, so publickey auth fails
  closed on every compressed session.
- **Root cause:** the secure side derives `PC_SECURE_ARENA_SIZE` from its `PC_WORK_*` terms, so a new
  draw that is not budgeted fails the build. The plaintext side has no equivalent derivation, so a
  new draw that is not budgeted fails at run time instead, on the path that happened to be second.
  `PC_PLAINTEXT_WORK_SSH_TRANSPORT` is defined and referenced nowhere, which is the same gap showing
  from the other direction.
- **Nothing can catch it:** an assert that a term fits alone passes for every term individually at
  any arena size down to the largest single term.
- **Fix:** not written. Derive the plaintext arena from its terms the way the secure one is derived,
  which turns both of the above into build failures.
- **Filed halves:** `git_project/audit/resource/mmgr_shared_primitives.md` (the missing derivation,
  and the 15,011 B sum), `network_drivers_ssh_security_codec.md` (the 8,760 B draw and the orphan).

## `Content-Length` folds with no overflow guard, so a 33-digit value frames as 0

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/http1-core.md` #1).
- **Symptom:** `http_parser.c:381` is `cl = cl * 10 + (size_t)(*q - '0')` inside the digit loop, with a
  digit-class check and a duplicate-disagreement check around it and no bound on the accumulator.
  `Content-Length: 18446744073709551616` folds to **0** on both 32- and 64-bit `size_t`;
  `Content-Length: 4294967301` folds to **5** on 32-bit, which is the ESP32 target. The parser reaches
  `PARSE_COMPLETE`/`PARSE_BODY` and the residual octets are reparsed as a pipelined request.
- **Root cause:** the comment three lines above cites RFC 7230 §3.3.2 `Content-Length = 1*DIGIT` and the
  loop enforces exactly that - the grammar, not the range. RFC 9110 sec 8.6 states the other half in the
  same paragraph: a recipient "MUST anticipate potentially large decimal numerals and prevent parsing
  errors due to integer conversion overflows". RFC 9112 sec 6.3 item 5 makes an invalid `Content-Length`
  a 400 and a connection close. This is a live request-smuggling vector.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_pentest.c:217` feeds the 20-digit value and then asserts only
  `assert_http_bounded()` (`:105-112`: buffer indices in range, `parse_state` a valid enum), which cannot
  distinguish 400 from silent acceptance.
- **Fix:** not written. Refuse when `cl > (SIZE_MAX - 9) / 10` before the multiply and return
  `PARSE_BAD_REQUEST`, and give the test an assertion on the status rather than on boundedness.

## Telnet sends 22 bytes from a 19-character literal on every accept

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09. Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-auth-connection-telnet.md` #15).
- **Symptom:** `telnet.c:142` is `raw_send(slot, "PC Telnet ready\r\n> ", 22);`. The literal is 19
  characters, 20 bytes with its NUL. Two bytes past the end of the string constant are read and pushed
  onto the wire on every connection.
- **Root cause:** a hand-counted length on a literal. Nothing recomputes it, and `raw_send` takes the
  count as given.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_telnet.c:60-69` compares only the first 6 bytes of the greeting.
- **Fix:** the call site was already `raw_send(slot, greet, sizeof(greet) - 1)` (19 bytes); the accept
  test now pins the whole 25-byte output (negotiation + greeting) so a hand-counted over-read cannot
  regress. Verified: `native_telnet`.

## Telnet ends a subnegotiation on a bare 240, injecting the parameter bytes into the command line

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`telnet.c` `TN_SB`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC
  conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-auth-connection-telnet.md` #4).
- **Symptom:** `TN_SB` closed on a bare `T_SE` (240), but RFC 855 terminates a subnegotiation only on
  `IAC SE` (255 240). A data byte 240 inside the parameters ended the subnegotiation early, and the
  bytes after it fell through to the NVT command line - an injection.
- **Nothing can catch it:** the only subneg test fed a bare 240 as the terminator and asserted the
  trailing bytes became the line, enshrining the bug.
- **Fix:** a `TN_SB_IAC` state, so a subnegotiation ends only on `IAC SE` and a bare 240 is data. The
  test now uses `IAC SE`, and a negative test proves a bare 240 mid-parameters does not inject.
  Verified: `native_telnet`, 23/23.

## The SSH userauth service name is parsed and never compared

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`ssh_auth.c` `pc_ssh_auth_parse_request`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-auth-connection-telnet.md` #3).
- **Symptom:** `ssh_auth.c:279` reads the `service` field of `SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST` into
  `req->service`, and that member appears nowhere else in the file. A request naming service `"bogus"`
  authenticates exactly as one naming `"ssh-connection"`.
- **Root cause:** RFC 4252 sec 5 makes the service name part of what is authenticated - "if the service
  does not exist, authentication MUST NOT be accepted" - and it is also inside the signed blob, so the
  signature covers a value the server never checks. Parsing a field into a struct is not validating it.
- **Nothing can catch it:** every test hardcodes `"ssh-connection"`.
- **Fix:** the parser rejects any service but `ssh-connection` (`str.eq`, the bounded compare), so a
  foreign name fails the request (RFC 4252 sec 5). Negative test `test_parse_rejects_foreign_service`.
  Verified: `native_ssh`, 265/265.

## A publickey signature is verified against a session id that no key exchange produced

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`ssh_auth.c` `pc_ssh_auth_handle_pubkey`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing
  `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-auth-connection-telnet.md` #2).
- **Symptom:** the signed blob is `string(session_id) || request` (RFC 4252 sec 7), but the length was
  taken from `ssh_sess[i].session_id_len` without consulting `have_session_id`. Before any KEX both are
  zero, so the blob degenerated to `uint32(0) || prefix`: a signature bound to no session at all, which
  is exactly the binding the field exists to provide.
- **Nothing can catch it:** every publickey test called one `set_session_id_0_to_31()` helper, so no
  test ever drove the handler with no session id bound.
- **Fix:** the signature path refuses when `have_session_id` is false. Negative test
  `test_pubkey_without_session_id_fails`. Reachability was already limited by the phase guard in
  `ssh_server.c`, so this closes the auth layer rather than a live hole.
  Verified: `native_ssh` + 14 more envs, 573/573.

## `pty-req`, `exec` and `env` are accepted on the request name alone

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`ssh_channel.c` `pc_ssh_channel_handle_request`). Found 2026-08-08
  auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-auth-connection-telnet.md` #8, #9).
- **Symptom:** acceptance was one boolean over four `mem.cmp` name matches, so a CHANNEL_REQUEST
  truncated immediately after `want_reply` was answered `CHANNEL_SUCCESS`. A `pty-req` carrying no
  TERM, no dimensions and no mode blob, and an `exec` carrying no command, both succeeded.
- **Nothing can catch it:** the accept-set test sent exactly that truncated form and asserted SUCCESS,
  and the SCP test passed a declared-but-absent command through the same path.
- **Fix:** each type is checked for the fields RFC 4254 sec 6.2 / 6.4 / 6.5 defines for it, read from a
  copy of the offset so the file-transfer classifier still finds the exec argument. `shell` is
  unchanged, carrying no request-specific data. New negative
  `test_chan_request_truncated_fields_refused`; the two tests that pinned the old behaviour now assert
  the RFC's. Verified: `native_ssh` + 14 more envs, 573/573.

## NVT `CR NUL` discards the carriage return and strands the line

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`telnet.c` `handle_data`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC
  conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-auth-connection-telnet.md` #12).
- **Symptom:** RFC 854 gives `CR NUL` as a carriage return alone, and clients send it for Enter. `CR`
  returned early awaiting `LF`, then the `NUL` was swallowed by the `b < 0x20` control-byte arm, so
  neither byte did anything: the line was never dispatched and the user's Enter did nothing.
- **Nothing can catch it:** the only CR test used `{'a','\r',0x01,'b','\n'}`, which never pairs CR with
  NUL.
- **Fix:** a `saw_cr` flag pairs the CR with whichever byte completes it, and `CR LF` and `CR NUL` both
  end the line through one `dispatch_line`. Test `test_cr_nul_dispatches_line`.
  Verified: `native_telnet`, 24/24.

## `CHANNEL_WINDOW_ADJUST` and `CHANNEL_EOF` skip the pre-auth guard the other six arms have

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`ssh_server.c` `pc_ssh_server_dispatch`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing
  `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-auth-connection-telnet.md` #13).
- **Symptom:** six channel arms open with `if (!s->authed) return -1;` and these two did not, so both
  were dispatched on an unauthenticated session. Not exploitable: `chan_by_id` finds no open channel
  before authentication, so both handlers were no-ops. Fixed as an asymmetry, not a live hole.
- **Nothing can catch it:** the `authed_arms[]` list the three suites iterate omitted exactly these two
  message types, so the gap was enshrined rather than caught.
- **Fix:** both arms carry the guard, and the `authed_arms[]` list in all three suites now names all
  eight. Verified: `native_ssh` + 14 more envs, 573/573.

## Two SSH test envs build the SSH stack without defining `PC_ENABLE_SSH`

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`test/test_matrix.json`, `native_ssh_hardened` and `native_ssh_pqc`).
  Found 2026-08-09 while running the suites for the four fixes above.
- **Symptom:** both envs list the SSH sources in `src` but their `flags` never define
  `PC_ENABLE_SSH=1`, so the derived arena terms for SSH were absent and the pool borrows on the
  publickey and KEX paths failed. Every borrow-taking test in them failed closed:
  `test_ecdsa_publickey_auth_succeeds_when_password_disabled` returned USERAUTH_FAILURE, and all five
  `native_ssh_pqc` KEX tests returned -1 out of `ssh_kexinit_parse`.
- **Nothing can catch it:** the tests that do not take a borrow still pass, so each env looked healthy
  as long as nobody added one that does. `native_ssh_pqc` now runs 10 cases where it reported 5.
- **Fix:** both envs declare `PC_ENABLE_SSH=1`, then `platformio.ini` regenerated with
  `test/gen_test_envs.py`. A sweep of the matrix found no third env in this state.
  Verified: `native_ssh_hardened` 4/4, `native_ssh_pqc` 10/10.

## The cipher and MAC were forced equal both ways, so a conforming client could not key

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`ssh_transport.c` `ssh_kexinit_parse`, `ssh_keymat.h`, `ssh_dh.c`,
  `ssh_packet.c`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance
  (`git_project/audit/ssh-transport-kex.md` #6).
- **Symptom:** `ssh_transport.c:674` rejected the KEXINIT when `s2c != c2s`, and `:700` when
  `m_s2c != m_c2s`. RFC 4253 sec 7.1 negotiates the two cipher lists and the two MAC lists
  independently, so a client whose directions carried different preferences was refused outright even
  though each list negotiated cleanly on its own.
- **Root cause:** the session and the keymat each held one `cipher_alg` / `mac_alg`, so the two
  directions had nowhere to differ. Everything else was already per-direction: `aes_key_c2s/_s2c`,
  `chacha_key_*`, `gcm_ctx_*`, and both 64-byte `mac_key_*` buffers.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_kexinit_parse_rejects_direction_mismatch` asserted the `-1`, pinning
  the behaviour the RFC contradicts.
- **Fix:** the mode is stored per direction (`cipher_mode_c2s/_s2c`, `mac_mode_c2s/_s2c`) and read
  through `km_send_cipher` / `km_recv_cipher` / `km_send_mac_mode` / `km_recv_mac_mode`, mirroring the
  existing `km_send_mac` / `km_recv_mac` key selectors. `ssh_keymat_wipe` releases each GCM context on
  its own mode, so a mixed session cannot leak one. The test now asserts both directions negotiate
  independently. Verified: `native_ssh` + 16 more envs, 594 cases.

## A wrong KEX guess was parsed as the real KEXDH_INIT

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`ssh_transport.c` `ssh_kexinit_parse`, `ssh_server.c` KEXDH_INIT arm).
  Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-transport-kex.md` #5).
- **Symptom:** the KEXINIT parser returned after the two compression name-lists and never read the two
  language lists, the `first_kex_packet_follows` boolean, or the reserved uint32. A client that guesses
  sends its KEXDH_INIT ahead of our reply; when the guess lost negotiation that packet carries an
  algorithm nobody agreed on, and RFC 4253 sec 7.1 says it MUST be silently ignored. It was parsed as
  the genuine one instead.
- **Root cause:** the fields after compression were simply never consumed, so the flag that says "a
  speculative packet is coming" was invisible to the server.
- **Nothing can catch it:** every test builder hard-codes the flag to 0, so no test ever sent a guess.
  OpenSSH and CycloneSSH do not guess either, which is why the interop suite never saw it.
- **Fix:** the parser reads the remaining fields and records `drop_guessed_kex_pkt` when the flag is
  set and negotiation did not settle on the client's first-listed kex _and_ host key -
  `negotiate_alg` now reports the winning entry's position, so "the guess held" is position 0 in both.
  The dispatcher consumes one KEXDH_INIT silently when the flag is up. Every `negotiate_*` caller moved
  from `!f(...)` to `f(...) < 0`, since position 0 is a success. Test
  `test_wrong_kex_guess_is_dropped`. Verified: `native_ssh` + 4 more envs, 342 cases.

## EXT_INFO was re-advertised on every re-key

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`ssh_server.c` NEWKEYS arm). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC
  conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-transport-kex.md` #12).
- **Symptom:** the NEWKEYS arm emitted EXT_INFO whenever `ext_info_c` was set, and
  `ssh_kexinit_parse` re-reads that flag from every KEXINIT including a re-key's, so the message went
  out again on each one. RFC 8308 sec 2.4 gives a server exactly two places to send it: after its
  first NEWKEYS, or immediately preceding USERAUTH_SUCCESS.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_ssh_kexinit_midsession_rekey` drives a full re-key with an
  ext-info-c-bearing KEXINIT and never checked what the second NEWKEYS emitted.
- **Fix:** `ext_info_sent` on the session gates it to the first NEWKEYS. The re-key test now asserts no
  EXT_INFO follows. Verified: `native_ssh`, `ssh_comp`, `ssh_kbdint`, `ssh_pqc`, 337 cases.

## The identification-string bound was off by two against RFC 4253 sec 4.2

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`ssh_transport.c` `ssh_transport_recv_banner`). Found 2026-08-08
  auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-transport-kex.md` #15).
- **Symptom:** the banner was rejected only at `n >= SSH_VERSION_MAX` (256) measured on the content
  with CR stripped, so 255 content bytes plus CR LF - 257 on the wire - was accepted. RFC 4253 sec 4.2
  bounds the string at 255 _including_ the Carriage Return and Line Feed, so the content limit is 253.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_banner_and_build_caps` pinned only the 256-byte rejection, leaving
  the RFC's actual bound untested in both directions.
- **Fix:** `SSH_VERSION_CONTENT_MAX` (253) is the bound the SSH- line is checked against.
  `test_recv_banner_rfc_length_bound` pins 253 accepted and 254 refused.
  Verified: `native_ssh` + 16 more envs.

## Every TLS connection init drew a fresh persistent borrow it never gave back

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`tls_conn.c` `tls_conn_slot_storage`). Found 2026-08-09 building the
  per-file suite the driver did not have.
- **Symptom:** `conn_init` called `pc_secure_wipe(c, sizeof(*c))` and then `secure.persist_span()`.
  The wipe nulls the very pointers that record whether the connection already holds storage, so the
  guard could never fire: a slot that closed and was re-accepted took another borrow from the
  persistent end, which is never given back. `MAX_TLS_CONNS` inits exhaust the pool permanently.
- **Root cause:** the borrow was treated as a property of the call rather than of the connection.
  `ssh_pkt_slot_storage` had the answer already - a null check on the slot's own first pointer, one
  span, split by named offsets into the slot's fields - and the shape was not copied.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `tls_conn.c` compiled in no test env at all.
- **Fix:** `tls_conn_slot_storage(TlsConn *c)` is `ssh_pkt_slot_storage` against `TlsConn`: returns
  early when `c->tx` is set, otherwise takes the one borrow and splits it across `tx`, `rx`,
  `terms`, `hash_work`, `sign_work`, `ks_work` and `hello`. `ks_work` is new - the key schedule
  reached its region by arithmetic on the borrow base, so it now has a field like the rest. init
  wipes the borrowed bytes and the session state, never the pointers. `native_tls_conn` is the env
  that was missing; the suite holds its connection in static storage, the way a pool slot is, and
  re-initialises the one slot per case, which is the path that was broken.
  Verified: `native_tls_conn` 5/5, 209/209 across thirteen TLS/DTLS/crypto envs.

## The portable TLS arm could not be built at all

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`protocore_config.h`). Found 2026-08-09 standing up `native_tls_conn`.
- **Symptom:** `tls_conn.c:41` asserts `PC_ENABLE_TLS_RPK` because the portable arm authenticates by
  RFC 7250 raw public key, but the config guard accepted that flag only alongside `PC_ENABLE_DTLS`
  or `PC_ENABLE_HTTP3`. The two conditions cannot both hold for a standalone software-TLS build, so
  `PC_TLS_SOFTWARE` was unbuildable on its own - which is why it had no env.
- **Fix:** the guard names the portable arm as the third carrier of the extension.

## A zero-length TLS Handshake or Alert record was both sent and accepted

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`tls_record.c` `pc_tls_record_protect` / `_unprotect`). Found
  2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/tls13.md` #1).
- **Symptom:** RFC 8446 sec 5.4: "Implementations MUST NOT send Handshake and Alert records that
  have a zero-length TLSInnerPlaintext.content; if such a message is received, the receiving
  implementation MUST terminate the connection with an 'unexpected_message' alert." Neither half
  was implemented: `protect` would seal one and `unprotect` would hand it back as a valid record.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_empty_plaintext_carries_only_the_type` sealed a zero-length alert
  and asserted it was accepted, pinning both halves of the violation.
- **Fix:** both directions refuse it, for Handshake and Alert only - application_data may be empty,
  which is how a sender pads a stream, and there is a test holding that open. The receive-side test
  builds the offending record through `protect` with a crafted content-type byte, since our own
  `protect` now declines to build it directly. The sec 5.4 all-zero-inner and sec 5.2 record-overflow
  guards were already correct but untested; both now have one. Verified: `native_tls_record` 20/20.

## A TLS 1.3 ClientHello's cipher_suites and compression methods were read past

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`tls13_msg.c`, `quic_tls.c`, `dtls_conn.c`, `tls_conn.c`). Found
  2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/tls13.md` #2, #3).
- **Symptom:** the parser read `cipher_suites` into a local and discarded it, and all three servers
  answered `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` unconditionally - so a ClientHello that never offered that
  suite got it in the ServerHello, against RFC 8446 sec 4.1.3. `legacy_compression_methods` was
  likewise read and dropped, where sec 4.1.2 says it "MUST contain exactly one byte, set to zero"
  and a TLS 1.3 server aborts on anything else.
- **Fix:** the parser reports the offer as `offers_aes128gcm_sha256`, matching the `offers_tls13`
  shape already in `Tls13ClientHello`, and all three servers refuse a ClientHello without it. The
  compression rule is enforced in the parser, where a malformed field belongs.
- **Note on the memory:** `Tls13ClientHello` lives inside the TLS connection's own borrow
  (`tls_conn.c` `TLS_OFF_HELLO`), and `TLS_OFF_KS` is derived from `sizeof(Tls13ClientHello)`, so
  growing the struct shifts the offsets after it. They follow correctly because they are computed
  rather than written down, and the `PC_TLS_CONN_STATE_CAP` static_assert proves the slot still
  covers them. Verified: 184/184 across all ten TLS/DTLS envs plus `native_crypto_kat`.

## HKDF-Expand had no published-vector coverage at all

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`hkdf.h` `pc_hkdf_expand`, `test_crypto_kat.c`, the RFC 5869 vector
  file and its curator/generator). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance
  (`git_project/audit/tls13.md` #5, #11).
- **Symptom:** the vector file carried `salt`/`ikm`/`prk` and the suite called only
  `pc_hkdf_extract`. Expand - the half that derives every TLS and QUIC traffic key - was checked
  against nothing published. The only >32-byte check anywhere was `test_quic_crypto.c`'s
  `expand_label_ref`, a line-by-line mirror of the same T(i) loop in the same file, so a shared
  convention error (T(0) as 32 zeros rather than empty) agreed with itself and passed.
- **Root cause of the gap:** only `pc_hkdf_expand_label` was public, and it wraps `info` in the
  RFC 8446 HkdfLabel structure. RFC 5869 Appendix A expands an arbitrary `info`, so its vectors
  could not reach the code through the exported surface at all.
- **Fix:** `pc_hkdf_expand` is exported - the bare sec 2.3 primitive the file already implemented
  internally, which is what the RFC's own vectors address. The vector file, its curator and the
  generator field list now carry `info`, `L` and `OKM` for A.1-A.3, and both halves run. A.2 asks
  for 82 bytes, three SHA-256 blocks, which is the only published multi-block case and the first
  external check the T(i) chain has ever had. The mirror in `test_quic_crypto.c` stays, narrowed to
  what it alone covers - that the HkdfLabel wrapper feeds the chain the right info block - and its
  comment now names the external anchor. Verified: 201/201 across twelve crypto/TLS/DTLS envs.

## HKDF-Expand past 255 blocks silently reused earlier key material

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`hkdf.c` `hkdf_expand`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC
  conformance (`git_project/audit/tls13.md` #12).
- **Symptom:** RFC 5869 sec 2.3 bounds L at 255*HashLen because the block counter is one octet. The
  counter was a `uint8_t` incremented without a bound, so a request for more than 8160 bytes wrapped
  it and T(256) repeated T(1) - the output would silently reuse key material already emitted.
- **Root cause:** the loop was written for the QUIC case, where the request never exceeds one hash
  block; the general N-block form was correct but unbounded.
- **Fix:** a request past the RFC's limit has no defined answer, so it produces none - the output is
  zeroed rather than filled with repeating blocks. No in-tree caller comes close to the bound.

## HTTP/3 error codes had no correct frame to travel in

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`quic_frame.c` `pc_quic_build_connection_close`, `quic_conn.c`
  `pc_quic_conn_close_app`). Found 2026-08-09 implementing the HTTP/3 state-machine rules from
  `git_project/audit/quic-http3-qpack.md`.
- **Symptom:** the close path could only build a transport CONNECTION_CLOSE (0x1c). RFC 9114 sec 8
  carries HTTP/3 errors in the application variant (0x1d), whose code comes from the application's
  space. Sent as 0x1c, `H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED` (0x0105) lands in the transport space of RFC 9000
  sec 20.1, where 0x0100-0x01ff is CRYPTO_ERROR plus a TLS alert - so the peer would read a frame
  sequencing error as "crypto failure, TLS alert 5". The frame parser already accepted both types;
  only the builder and the queue were transport-only.
- **Fix:** the builder takes the variant and omits the Frame Type field for 0x1d, which sec 19.19
  says that variant does not carry. `queue_close` records which was chosen. `pc_quic_conn_close_app`
  is the entry point for an application error; per sec 10.2.3 the 0x1d frame is only legal in
  0-RTT/1-RTT, so before those keys exist it falls back to a transport close with APPLICATION_ERROR,
  and there is a test for that arm. Verified: `native_quic_frame`, `native_quic_conn`,
  `native_h3_conn` and three more, 105/105.

## The HTTP/3 engine enforced none of its stream or frame-sequence rules

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`h3_conn.c`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance
  (`git_project/audit/quic-http3-qpack.md` #1, #2, #3, #8, #9).
- **Symptom:** five RFC 9114 MUSTs, none implemented. SETTINGS on a request stream was skipped as
  if it were an unknown frame type (sec 7.2.4). A control stream whose first frame was not SETTINGS
  was consumed and ignored (sec 6.2.1). A second SETTINGS re-defaulted and re-parsed, so a peer
  could reconfigure the connection at any time (sec 7.2.4). Every uni stream typed 0x00 became a
  control stream, with no check that one already existed (sec 6.2.1). A DATA frame arriving before
  any HEADERS was accumulated into the body (sec 4.1).
- **Nothing can catch it:** two of the tests asserted the permissive behaviour outright - one
  called a SETTINGS frame on a request stream "legal on the wire but meaningless here" and asserted
  the request dispatched anyway; the other asserted a first-frame GOAWAY was "consumed and ignored".
- **Fix:** each rule is now a connection error carrying its sec 8.1 code, sent through the 0x1d
  close above. The request-stream check covers the other control-stream-only frames (GOAWAY,
  MAX_PUSH_ID, CANCEL_PUSH) at the same time. Verified: `native_h3_conn` and five more, 105/105.

## QUIC accepted packets with a clear Fixed Bit, non-zero Reserved Bits, or an oversize max_streams

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`quic_packet.c`, `quic_conn.c`, `quic_tp.c`). Found 2026-08-08
  auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/quic-http3-qpack.md` #4, #5, #6, #7).
- **Symptom:** `pc_quic_parse_long_header` tested only the header-form bit and
  `pc_quic_parse_short_header` only its absence, so a packet with the Fixed Bit (0x40) clear parsed
  normally where RFC 9000 sec 17.2 / 17.3.1 says it "MUST be discarded". The Reserved Bits were
  never read, though sec 17.2 makes a non-zero value a PROTOCOL_VIOLATION. `initial_max_streams_bidi`
  and `_uni` took any 62-bit varint, where sec 4.6 caps them at 2^60.
- **Fix:** the long-header test exempts version 0, which is the Version Negotiation packet the RFC
  excludes; a short header is never one, so it holds there without exception. The Reserved Bits are
  read in `quic_conn` after the AEAD open rather than inside `pc_quic_packet_unprotect`: the header
  is authenticated by then, so a bit flipped in flight cannot close a connection, and the connection
  is also the only layer that can send the error. Verified: `native_quic_packet`, `native_quic_tp`
  and six more.

## The HTTP/2 engine accepted frames RFC 9113 requires it to reject

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`h2_conn.c` `dispatch_frame`, `handle_continuation`). Found
  2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/http2-hpack.md`, the
  lower-severity remainder) and by an earlier spec audit of `h2_conn.c`.
- **Symptom:** the dispatcher branched on frame type and went straight to the handler. It never
  checked the per-type length or stream id, so all of the following were accepted: RST_STREAM on
  stream 0 and at any length, PRIORITY at any length and on stream 0, GOAWAY shorter than its two
  mandatory fields and on a non-zero stream, SETTINGS and PING on a non-zero stream, and
  RST_STREAM or WINDOW_UPDATE naming a stream no HEADERS had ever opened.
- **Root cause:** `pc_h2_parse_header` validates the framing, and each handler validated what it
  needed to do its own job. Nothing owned the rules that are a property of the frame type itself.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_h2_unknown_stream_frames` asserted three of these were tolerated,
  so the suite pinned the violation.
- **Fix:** each case now carries its sec 6.x length and stream-id test. The idle-stream rule
  (sec 5.1) is expressed against `last_peer_stream`, which separates a stream that was never opened
  from one opened and since closed - the latter may still receive a late WINDOW_UPDATE (sec 6.9)
  and ignore it, and there is a test for each. A wrong PRIORITY length is a stream error, so the
  connection survives it; the rest are connection errors.
  Verified: `native_h2conn` 56/56.

## An empty HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frame could be sent without end

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`h2_conn.c` `handle_continuation`, `PC_H2_MAX_CONTINUATION`).
- **Symptom:** a header block spanning CONTINUATION frames was bounded only by `PC_H2_HDR_BLOCK`,
  the bytes it may accumulate. A CONTINUATION carrying no payload adds no bytes, so a peer could
  send them without limit and the block would never have to end, at no memory cost to the attacker.
- **Fix:** `PC_H2_MAX_CONTINUATION` bounds the frame count as well as the byte total. The two
  bounds answer different questions and the byte one could never have answered this.
  Verified: `native_h2conn` 56/56.

## Eight CoAPS server tests were failing on a double-address argument

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`test_coaps_server.c` `client_get_temp`, `assert_coap_205`). Found
  2026-08-09 sweeping the envs that build the shared HTTP sources.
- **Symptom:** `native_coaps_server` ERRORED, 8 of 21 cases red, every one on
  `TEST_ASSERT_TRUE(pc_coaps_server_ingest(...))` returning FALSE.
- **Root cause:** not the ingest. `client_get_temp(DtlsRecordKeys *w, ...)` called
  `DtlsRecord.protect(&w, ...)` - the address of its own pointer parameter, a `DtlsRecordKeys **`,
  where `protect` takes `DtlsRecordKeys *`. The sealer read a stack slot holding a pointer as key
  material, produced nothing, and returned 0. `ring_push` refuses a zero-length datagram, so the
  failure surfaced one call later at the ingest. `assert_coap_205` had the same defect on
  `unprotect`. The two sibling call sites at `:387` and `:410` are correct - they take the address
  of real `DtlsRecordKeys` values, which is what made the wrong pair look idiomatic.
- **Nothing can catch it:** the incompatible pointer type is a warning, not an error, and the suite
  is not built with warnings as errors.
- **Fix:** pass the pointer through. Verified: `native_coaps_server` 21/21, `native_coaps` 6/6.

## The HTTP/2 bridge ran no RFC 9113 sec 8.2 / 8.3 header validation at all

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`h2_server.c` `cb_header` / `cb_headers_end`). Found 2026-08-08
  auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/http2-hpack.md` #3, #4, #5).
- **Symptom:** any header block the HPACK decoder could parse was mapped into the slot's `HttpReq`
  and marked `PARSE_COMPLETE`. A request with no `:method`, two `:path` fields, a pseudo-header
  after a regular one, an undefined pseudo-header, an uppercase field name, a colon inside a
  non-pseudo name, a value wrapped in whitespace, or a `Connection` / `Transfer-Encoding` /
  `Upgrade` field all reached the route dispatcher. The audit names this the request-smuggling
  surface: a front end and this server would disagree about where one request ends.
- **Root cause:** the callback was written as a field-extraction chain (`:method` -> `:path` ->
  `:authority` -> other), never as a validator. Nothing in the module held per-block state, so no
  duplicate or ordering rule could have been expressed even if one had been wanted.
- **Nothing can catch it:** no test env compiled `h2_server.c`. The module had zero coverage.
- **Fix:** one bit per pseudo-header in the module's owned context, plus a "regular field seen" bit
  and a "condemned" bit. A duplicate and an out-of-order pseudo-header are one AND against the mask;
  the sec 8.3.1 mandatory set is one XOR at the end of the block. Field-name bytes go through a
  256-bit table indexed with `>> 5` and `& 31`. `on_headers_end` now returns the verdict, and the
  engine - which owns the frame borrow - answers RST_STREAM(PROTOCOL_ERROR) from the dispatcher's
  span. `native_h2server` is the env that was missing; a mutation run with the verdict disabled put
  13 of its 15 cases red, so the suite observes the validation and not the transport.
  Verified: `native_h2server` 15/15, `native_h2conn` 36/36.

## An HTTP/2 content-length was never measured against the body

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`h2_conn.c` `content_length_holds`, `note_content_length`). Found
  2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/http2-hpack.md`, remainder).
- **Symptom:** a request could declare `content-length: 10`, send five octets, and have them
  delivered as a complete body; or declare 2 and send 5; or declare a body and end the stream with
  its headers. RFC 9113 sec 8.1.1 makes each of those malformed. Two disagreeing accounts of one
  body's length is the primitive every request-smuggling attack is built from.
- **Root cause:** `h2_server` parsed content-length into `HttpReq` for the application's benefit
  and nothing compared it to anything. `h2_conn`, which owns both the stream state and the DATA
  accounting, never saw the header as meaning anything.
- **Fix:** the declaration is recorded on its stream as the block decodes, the DATA is counted, and
  the two are settled before any payload reaches the application - the moment the body goes over
  the declared length, or at END_STREAM if it comes up short. A value that is not a plain decimal
  number, or appears twice, is malformed on its own. Each is a stream error, so the connection
  survives. Verified: `native_h2conn` 56/56.

## HTTP/2 trailers were a connection error

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`h2_conn.c` `handle_headers`, `decode_block`). Found 2026-08-08
  auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/http2-hpack.md` #14).
- **Symptom:** `handle_headers` rejected every HEADERS whose stream id did not exceed
  `last_peer_stream`, so a trailer section - which RFC 9113 sec 8.1 permits as a second HEADERS on
  an open stream - killed the connection.
- **Root cause:** sec 5.1.1's monotonicity rule governs a _newly established_ stream. The check
  conflated that with any repeat of an id, and `test_h2_stream_id_must_increase` pinned the
  conflation without separating the two cases.
- **Fix:** an id at or below `last_peer_stream` is now looked up. No stream, or one past OPEN, is
  still the sec 5.1.1 connection error; a stream still OPEN makes the block a trailer section. A
  trailer that does not carry END_STREAM, or that contains a pseudo-header (sec 8.1), draws
  RST_STREAM(PROTOCOL_ERROR). Trailers are decoded so the HPACK dynamic table stays in step with
  the peer's encoder, but never delivered: the request they trail has already been dispatched, and
  delivering them would have re-run `cb_headers_end` and dispatched it twice.
  Verified: `native_h2conn` 36/36.

## HTTP/2 DATA on a stream nobody opened was delivered to the application

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`h2_conn.c` `handle_data`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC
  conformance (`git_project/audit/http2-hpack.md` #2).
- **Symptom:** `handle_data` called `c->cb.on_data(...)` and only then looked the stream up, and it
  never read `H2Stream.state` at all. A DATA frame naming a stream no HEADERS had ever opened had its
  payload handed to the application as a legitimate request body. RFC 9113 sec 5.1 makes any frame
  other than HEADERS or PRIORITY on an idle stream a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR; sec 6.1
  makes DATA on a stream that is not open a stream error of type STREAM_CLOSED.
- **Root cause:** the lookup existed only to update `state` on END_STREAM, so it was placed after the
  delivery it should have gated. The audit names this the request-smuggling surface.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_h2_data_empty_and_unknown_stream` fed DATA on never-opened stream 5
  and asserted both that the call succeeded and that the body reached the app.
- **Fix:** the stream is resolved before the callback. No stream at all is a connection error; a
  stream past OPEN is answered RST_STREAM(STREAM_CLOSED) and the connection survives. The test now
  asserts the payload does not arrive, and `test_h2_data_after_end_stream_resets_the_stream` covers
  the sec 6.1 half. Verified: `native_h2conn`, 32/32.

## An HTTP/2 WINDOW_UPDATE of zero was accepted, and the window add could overflow

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`h2_conn.c` `dispatch_frame`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for
  RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/http2-hpack.md` #6, #7).
- **Symptom:** the increment was added with no checks. RFC 9113 sec 6.9 makes a zero increment an
  error, and sec 6.9.1 caps a flow-control window at 2^31-1 with anything beyond it a
  FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR. `c->conn_send_window += (int32_t)inc` with `inc` up to 2^31-1 is signed
  overflow, which is undefined behaviour, not a large window.
- **Nothing can catch it:** the only WINDOW_UPDATE test sent +100 on each of the connection and a
  stream, so neither the zero nor the boundary was ever driven.
- **Fix:** both are rejected, and the RFC's split is honoured - a connection error on the connection
  window, RST_STREAM on a stream's (PROTOCOL_ERROR for zero, FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR for the cap). The cap
  is tested by subtracting from the ceiling rather than adding to the window, so the check itself
  cannot overflow. Test `test_h2_window_update_zero_and_overflow`.
  Verified: `native_h2conn`, 32/32.

## An oversize HPACK dynamic-table size update was clamped instead of refused

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`hpack.c` `pc_hpack_decode`, the 0x20 arm). Found 2026-08-08 auditing
  `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/http2-hpack.md` #1).
- **Symptom:** a size update naming any value was accepted; `dyn_set_max` silently lowered it to the
  table's storage. RFC 7541 sec 6.3 says a value above the limit the enclosing protocol determined
  MUST be a decoding error, and RFC 9113 sec 4.3 makes a decoding error in a field block a connection
  error of type COMPRESSION_ERROR. So a peer's illegal update was taken as a legal one.
- **Root cause:** the clamp reads as defensive, and it does keep the table inside its storage, but it
  is answering a different question than the RFC asks. The limit here is 4096: `h2_conn.c` advertises
  no SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE, so the RFC 9113 sec 6.5.2 default applies and it equals
  `PC_HPACK_TABLE_BYTES`.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_dyn_size_update` encoded an update to 100000 and asserted the decode
  returned TRUE, pinning the clamp as correct.
- **Fix:** the decode refuses `nm > HPACK_BYTES` before applying it. The test now pins the boundary -
  4096 applied, 4097 and 100000 refused. Verified: `native_hpack` + 6 more, 96/96.

## HPACK prefix-integer decode wraps at `m == 28`

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`hpack_prim.c` `pc_hpack_decode_int`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing
  `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/http2-hpack.md` #8).
- **Symptom:** `hpack_prim.c:137` bounds the continuation with `m > 28`, so `m == 28` is admitted and
  `(b & 0x7f) << 28` shifts up to 127 into a `uint32_t`. Confirmed by compiling the function verbatim:
  input `{0x1f,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x7f}` returns TRUE with `consumed = 6` and `value = 4026531871`
  (`0xf000001f`); the encoded value is 34091302943.
- **Root cause:** the comment reads "bound the continuation to a 32-bit result" and the bound is one
  step too loose - at `m == 28` only the low 4 bits of the septet still fit. RFC 7541 sec 5.1 requires
  that an integer exceeding implementation limits "in value or octet length" be a decoding error.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_hpack.c:439-440` pins only the `m > 28` rejection.
- **Fix:** the septet is rejected when `m == 28 && (b & 0x7f) > 0x0f`, and the running sum is checked
  against `0xFFFFFFFF - v` before it is added, so neither the shift nor the add can wrap. Test
  `test_int_decode_rejects_overflowing_prefix_int` pins the audit's own vector plus the boundary
  either side (`0x0f` accepted, `0x10` refused) and the octet-length bound.
  Verified: `native_hpack`, `native_h2conn`, `native_qpack` and four more, 96/96 - QPACK shares this
  primitive, so the fix is on the HTTP/3 path too.

## `pc_base64url_decode` stops at `=` and reports the partial decode as success

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/websocket-and-codecs.md` #2).
- **Symptom:** `base64.c:330-333` breaks out of the loop on `'='` and returns the bytes accumulated so
  far as the decoded length. `pc_base64url_decode("Zm9v=", 5, ...)` returns 3. Everything after the
  first `=` is discarded without a diagnostic, so on the JWT/JWS path `<segment>=<anything>` decodes
  identically to `<segment>`.
- **Root cause:** the branch is commented "optional padding ends the input (public length information)",
  which is the base64 rule, not the base64url one. RFC 4648 sec 3.2/sec 5 and RFC 7515 sec 2 give
  base64url no padding at all, and sec 3.3 requires rejecting any character outside the alphabet. The
  surrounding decoder is carefully branchless for constant time; this one early `break` is the hole in
  it, and it is also the only place the function can return a short count as success.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_base64.c:141-147` asserts the 3 and pins the behavior as correct.
- **Fix:** not written. Fold `'='` into the `bad` accumulator like every other non-alphabet byte and
  drop the early break; correct the test to assert rejection.

## SSE field values are copied verbatim, so a newline in application data injects an event

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/websocket-and-codecs.md` #3).
- **Symptom:** `sse.c:110-142` `pc_sse_format` memcpy's `data`, `event` and `id` into the record with no
  escaping. A value containing `\n\n` terminates the record early and the remainder is parsed by the
  client as new fields; a single `\n` silently truncates the field.
- **Root cause:** the WHATWG event-stream format is line-oriented - CR, LF or CRLF separate lines and a
  blank line dispatches the event - so the field separator is in-band and application data has to be
  escaped or refused. The formatter treats the values as opaque bytes.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_sse.c:326-357` pins exact bytes only for newline-free values.
- **Fix:** not written. Refuse a value containing CR or LF, or re-emit each embedded newline as a fresh
  `data:` continuation line, which is what the format is for.

## An MQTT redelivery resends whatever the codec framed last

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/coap-mqtt.md` #3).
- **Symptom:** `mqtt.c:1141` sets `s_mqtt.tx[0] |= 0x08` and calls `mq_tx(s_mqtt.inflight[i].len)`. `tx`
  is one shared framing buffer that every later `pc_mqtt_build_ack` / `pingreq` / `subscribe` / second
  `PUBLISH` overwrites (`:776, :790, :814, :822, :1067, :1077, :1116`), so a retransmit sends the
  current contents of that buffer, with bit 3 set, for the _old_ PUBLISH's length. A PINGREQ `0xC0`
  goes out as `0xC8`.
- **Root cause:** the comment at `:1139-1140` states the invariant it relies on - "One packet is in
  flight at a time, so tx is that packet" - and `PC_MQTT_MAX_INFLIGHT` is 4, so the invariant is false.
  The retransmit needs the packet, and what it has is a buffer.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `native_mqtt` is a host build with `PC_HAS_NET_STACK` 0, so the whole
  transport - QoS 1/2 flows, dedup, keepalive, `MqLinkState` - is compiled by no test env.
- **Fix:** not written. The inflight record owns its bytes, or the DUP re-frame rebuilds the PUBLISH
  from the retained topic/payload. Wants a host env that compiles the transport first, or the fix is
  unverifiable in the same way the bug was.

## JWT claim validation fails open when there is no wall clock

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/http-cache-and-auth.md` #1).
- **Symptom:** `jwt.c:146-148` returns `PROTO_TRUE` from `pc_jwt_time_valid` whenever `now_epoch <= 0`,
  so on a device that has not yet synced time every `exp` and `nbf` is accepted. A token that expired in
  1970 validates.
- **Root cause:** the comment reads "no wall clock -> time claims cannot be evaluated (the signature is
  the gate)", which chooses availability over the RFC 7519 sec 4.1.4 MUST NOT. An unevaluatable claim is
  not a satisfied claim.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_jwt.c:286-287` asserts the fail-open as correct behavior for both
  `pc_jwt_time_valid` and `pc_jwt_verify_hs256_at`.
- **Fix:** not written. Fail closed when a token carries `exp`/`nbf` and no clock is available, or make
  the caller pass an explicit "time claims not required" flag so the decision is at the call site.

## The Digest response tag is compared with a plain byte compare

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/http-cache-and-auth.md`, non-RFC note).
- **Symptom:** `auth.c:519` is `if (!str.eq(expected, response, sizeof(expected), PROTO_TRUE))` on the
  computed versus client-supplied Digest response - an early-exit byte compare on an authentication tag,
  which is a timing oracle. `check_basic` at `auth.c:396-397` does use `pc_ct_eq`, so the two auth paths
  in one file disagree.
- **Root cause:** `protostr.h:113` states the rule in the library's own words - "A secret comparison uses
  `pc_ct_eq`" - and `str.eq` is the general-purpose comparison that stops at the first difference.
- **Fix:** not written. `pc_ct_eq` over the full 64-hex-character width, matching the Basic path.

## `serve_file_internal()` accepts a backend and never uses it

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/mocks` for harness holes (`git_project/audit/mock-mnt-and-support-fixtures.md` #3).
- **Symptom:** `file_serving.c:227` takes `const pc_mnt_backend *file_sys` and the body never reads it -
  `file_sys` occurs in the file only at `:227` (the parameter), `:525`/`:527` (passed through from
  `serve_file`) and `:530`/`:560` (recorded by `serve_static`). Line 230 goes straight to
  `pc_fs_open(file_root(), ...)`, the globally mounted store. An application following the documented
  `serve_static("/ram/", pc_mnt_ram(), "/")` idiom serves from whatever is mounted, not from the backend
  it named.
- **Root cause:** the multipoint mount table records the per-prefix backend (`mnt.c:47-57`) and
  `file_serving.c:637`/`:642` and `webdav_handler.c:433` read it back and pass it down, so the plumbing
  is complete up to the last function, which drops it. There is not even a `(void)file_sys;`, and the
  build is `-std=gnu11` without `-Wextra`, so the unused parameter is silent.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_file_serving.c:24` declares `static const pc_mnt_backend *g_fs;` and
  never assigns it, so all 18 `serve_static()` calls pass NULL. The `setUp` comment at `:69-70` records
  the symptom ("resolves through the accessor, not through the backend handed to `serve_file()`")
  without treating it as a defect.
- **Fix:** not written. Resolve through `file_sys` when it is non-NULL and fall back to the accessor
  otherwise, and give the test a second backend so the two are distinguishable.

## The plaintext SSH receive path accepts sub-minimum padding

- **Status:** FIXED 2026-08-09 (`ssh_packet.c` `ssh_recv_plain`). Found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for
  RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/ssh-transport-kex.md` #7).
- **Symptom:** `ssh_packet.c:747` checks only `pad_len_byte >= pkt_len`. All four encrypted receive
  paths check `< 4` (`:438`, `:514`, `:592`, `:700`); the pre-NEWKEYS path does not, so a packet
  declaring 0 to 3 bytes of padding is accepted there.
- **Root cause:** RFC 4253 sec 6 - "There MUST be at least four bytes of padding" - is enforced in the
  four places that were written together and missed in the fifth. `docs/SSH.md:73` claims the rule holds.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_ssh_server.c:582` covers only the over-large case (`6 >= 6`).
- **Fix:** the plaintext path carries the same `< 4` arm as the other four.
  Verified: `native_ssh` + 16 more envs.

## The AES-GCM vector corpus ships forty valid vectors and zero negatives

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/vectors` (`git_project/audit/crypto-primitives-and-vectors.md` #1).
- **Symptom:** `test/vectors/wycheproof_aes_128_gcm.json` holds 40 vectors, all `result:"valid"`. The
  runner executes all 40, so nothing is truncated downstream - the corpus itself contains no tampered
  tag, no flipped AAD byte, no truncated ciphertext. An AEAD is tested only on success.
- **Root cause:** `tools/crypto/curate_crypto_vectors.py:63-73` files a test under `flagged` when
  `result=="invalid"` **or** `t.get("flags")` is non-empty, then takes `flagged[:CAP_FLAGGED]` with the
  cap at 40 (`:37`). Every valid AES-GCM vector carries `Pseudorandom`/`Ktv`/`SpecialCase` (35/3/2 = 40
  exactly), so the cap fills with valid-but-flagged entries before the first `invalid` one is reached.
  The HMAC corpora survive the same code only by accident of ordering.
- **Fix:** not written. Select `invalid` first and fill the remainder with flagged-valid, or cap the two
  classes separately. Re-curating changes the committed corpus, so it wants its own commit.

## `pc_ct_eq` has no test of any kind

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for crypto coverage (`git_project/audit/crypto-primitives-and-vectors.md` #3).
- **Symptom:** `src/crypto/ct_eq.h:33` is the library's single comparator for, in its own doc comment
  (`:8-10`), "every MAC, tag, digest and signature check". Grep across `test/` returns no reference to
  the symbol - not a functional equality test, let alone a timing one.
- **Root cause:** it is a leaf primitive that every caller exercises indirectly, so no suite claimed it.
  An indirect exercise proves the callers agree with it, not that it is correct.
- **Fix:** not written. A functional suite (equal, differing at first byte, differing at last byte,
  zero length) is cheap; the timing claim wants the off-host CCOUNT harness `test_base64.c:6-7` already
  uses.

## DSCP is written as a whole byte, clobbering the ECN bits

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/fieldbus-and-files-naming.md` #1).
- **Symptom:** every DSCP application writes the entire IPv4 TOS / IPv6 Traffic-Class octet -
  `tcp_conn.c:385`, `tcp_listener.c:506`, `tcp_client.c:175`, `udp/udp_client.c:48`,
  `udp/udp_listener.c:176` - so bits 6-7 are zeroed to Not-ECT on every connection that sets a DSCP.
- **Root cause:** RFC 2474 defines the high 6 bits and RFC 3168 sec 5 gives the low 2 to ECN as a
  separate field with a separate owner. The setter treats the octet as one value.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_diffserv.c:57-68` always starts from `pcb.tos = 0`, and `:35` pins
  `pc_dscp_to_tos(63) == 0xFC` with the comment "ECN still 0" - so no test ever presents a pcb already
  carrying ECT(0), ECT(1) or CE.
- **Fix:** not written. Read-modify-write the octet, preserving the low two bits, at all five sites; add
  a test that seeds a non-zero ECN and asserts it survives.

## The DNS name decoder follows forward compression pointers

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for RFC conformance (`git_project/audit/fieldbus-and-files-naming.md` #7, #14).
- **Symptom:** `dns_wire.c:53` accepts any pointer offset within the message, including one greater than
  the current position, so forward and mutually-referential chains are followed - bounded only by the
  8-hop `PC_DNS_PTR_HOPS` counter. Separately, `dns_wire.c:82` bounds the assembled name only by the
  caller's `out_cap`, so with a large buffer a chain of 63-octet labels yields a name past the RFC 1035
  sec 2.3.4 limit of 255 octets.
- **Root cause:** RFC 1035 sec 4.1.4 defines a pointer as referring to "a prior occurrence of the same
  name". The hop counter makes the loop terminate, which is the DoS half; the direction rule and the
  total-length rule are the correctness half and neither is enforced.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `test_dns_wire.c:102-107` covers the self-pointer `{0xC0,0x00}` only - not a
  forward pointer, not a pointer past `len`, not an over-long assembled name.
- **Fix:** not written. Refuse an offset `>= cur`, and cap the assembled length at 255 independently of
  `out_cap`.

## The Modbus master never reads the MBAP transaction id or length

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing `test/` for standards conformance (`git_project/audit/fieldbus-and-files-naming.md` #2, #8).
- **Symptom:** none of the four response parsers - `modbus_master.c:46`, `:127`, `:323`, `:443` -
  accepts a transaction id or reads `adu[0..1]`, so a response cannot be matched to its request and a
  stale or injected response is accepted for whatever is outstanding. The same four check only `len < 9`
  and the protocol id, never `adu[4..5]` (Length) against the delivered byte count.
- **Root cause:** the Modbus Messaging Guide V1.0b sec 4.4.1.3 makes both checks mandatory - "If the
  Transaction Identifier doesn't refer to any MODBUS pending transaction, the response must be
  discarded" - and the parser API has no parameter through which the caller could supply the expected
  id. The MUST cannot be satisfied without a signature change.
- **Nothing can catch it:** no test feeds a mismatched transaction id, and the fixtures themselves carry
  inconsistent Length fields (`test_modbus_master.c:136`, `:376`) with no assertion on them.
- **Fix:** not written. Thread the outstanding transaction id into the parsers and discard on mismatch;
  validate Length against the frame. Correct the two fixtures in the same commit.

## The bounded-run walks existed twice, on two owners

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-08), found auditing ARCHITECTURE.md against the tree.
- **Symptom:** none at runtime. `shared_primitives/runops.h` and `mmgr/protostr.c` each carried a
  full implementation of the same operations on top of `mmgr/swar.h` - the NUL scan, the first-
  difference index, the agreement walk behind eq/starts, the search behind find/has, and the bounded
  copy. Neither was built on the other. 44 call sites across 10 files took the header, and the rest
  of the tree took `str`.
- **Root cause:** the walks moved into `mmgr/` with the byte layer and the header they came from was
  left in place, so the two drifted independently. SRCBANNED #13 bans exactly this ("an alias, a
  wrapper, a second spelling"), and the copies had already diverged in the small: `runops.h` used
  `?:` (banned by #23, carried in `sweep_baseline.json` as 20 whitelisted ternaries) where
  `protostr.c` spells the same dispatch as `if`/`else`.
- **Fix:** every call site rewritten onto `str` (`proto_scan_nul` -> `str.len`, `proto_diff*` ->
  `str.diff(..., ci)`, `proto_eq_str*` -> `str.eq(..., ci)`, `proto_starts*` -> `str.starts`,
  `proto_find*` / `proto_has*` -> `str.find` / `str.has`, `proto_copy` -> `str.copy`), and
  `runops.h` deleted. `native_dns_resolver`, `native_mdns_service`, `native_client` and
  `native_h3_server` gained `+<mmgr/protostr.c>`: the header was `static inline` and the module is
  not, so those four linked nothing before and needed the TU.
- **Note:** `str` is `extern const StrNs`, not the folding `static const` table `mem` and `swar` use,
  so a call through it is an indirect call the compiler cannot fold. On the hot paths that took the
  header inline - the HTTP method compare and the route match in `http.c` - that is a real change,
  measurable on the S3 bench (`test/penetration_testing/rig_firmware/src/main_swarbench.cpp`).

## The SSH client reads the peer's maximum packet size and throws it away

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 reconciling SWEEP_NOTES.md against the tree.
- **Symptom:** `ssh_client.c:1155` is `r_u32(&r); // their max packet` - the CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION
  field is parsed and discarded. The send pump then clamps to its own `SSH_CLI_MAXPKT` (16384,
  `:1145`) at `:1312`. Against a peer advertising a smaller maximum we emit an over-long
  CHANNEL_DATA; a strict peer drops the channel.
- **Root cause:** RFC 4254 sec 5.1 makes `maximum packet size` half of the same per-channel state as
  the window, and the client keeps a private copy of that state instead of the one owner:
  `ssh_client.c:302-303` declares `send_win` / `recv_win` and does its own arithmetic at
  `:1273-1334` and `:1477`, duplicating `SshFlow` (`ssh_flow_control.h`), which the server side has
  used since the signaling move. A second implementation of an invariant is a place the invariant
  can be dropped, and this is the field that was dropped.
- **Nothing can catch it:** `ssh_client.c` is compiled by **no** test env - all twelve `native_ssh*`
  entries in `test/test_matrix.json` list other sources, none lists `ssh_client.c`. ~1700 lines of
  client KEX, host-key verification, user auth and channels with zero coverage.
- **Fix:** not written. `CliChannel` folds onto `SshFlow`, which stores `peer_max_pkt` at open and
  gates the send, so the cap is the peer's and the check cannot be forgotten. Wants a
  `native_ssh_client` env first, or the fix is unverifiable in the same way the bug was.

## SSH packet state and key material sit in plain BSS, outside the secure pool

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 reconciling SWEEP_NOTES.md against the tree.
- **Symptom:** `ssh_packet.c:29` `SshPacketState ssh_pkt[MAX_SSH_CONNS];` and
  `ssh_keymat.c` `SshKeyMat ssh_keys[MAX_SSH_CONNS];` are file-scope arrays with external linkage.
  They hold decrypted packet bytes, key schedules and HMAC keys, and they are cleared by nothing on
  release.
- **Root cause:** their separation is incidental linker placement, which `ssh_keymat.h:85` already
  says out loud ("physical separation only raises the bar, not a hard wall"). The secure pool exists
  for exactly this content and wipes on release; as BSS these arrays are outside both it and the
  plaintext arena, so they are covered by neither derived worst case.
- **Fix:** not written. Both borrow from the secure pool with a declared `PC_WORK_SSH_*` term proved
  by a `static_assert` at the borrow site, the shape `crypto/aead/aes128gcm.h` already uses.

## The If-Modified-Since date is parsed with `sscanf`, under a comment that says "no stdlib"

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing stdio use in `src/`.
- **Symptom:** `file_serving.c:132` calls `sscanf(ims, "%*3s, %d %3s %d %d:%d:%d", ...)`. The comment
  four lines above it reads "Parses the date by hand (sscanf, no stdlib)". `sscanf` **is** stdlib -
  the sentence contradicts the line it describes, and a reader auditing for stdlib use believes it.
- **Root cause:** the file also calls `strftime` and `strstr`, so `<stdio.h>` and `<string.h>` are
  both live here. SRCBANNED ban 25 bans both headers in `src/`; the sites are in the ratcheted
  baseline, so the gate stays green and the comment is what a reader actually reads.
- **Cost:** `sscanf` pulls the full scanf format engine into the link, on a path that parses one
  fixed RFC 1123 shape - six integers and a three-character month at known positions.
- **Fix:** not written. Hand-parse the fixed layout with the existing decimal readers, delete both
  includes, and drop the two baseline entries in the same commit.

## Nineteen translation units carry a stale `#include <stdio.h>`

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 auditing stdio use in `src/`.
- **Symptom:** 27 files under `src/` include `<stdio.h>` (SRCBANNED ban 25, 31 ratcheted baseline
  entries whose text reads "nothing in src/ formats"). **19 of them reference no stdio symbol at
  all** - among them `server/middleware.c:17`, `server/websocket_sse.c:25`, `server/logbuf.c`,
  `server/power_mgmt.c`, `codec/json/json.c`, `ssh/transport/ssh_transport.c`. Eight more mention a
  stdio name only inside a comment.
- **Root cause:** the include outlived the `snprintf` calls that were replaced by `pc_sb`; nothing
  removes an include that nothing needs, and the baseline records the site rather than expiring it.
- **Fix:** not written. Delete the 19 dead includes and their baseline entries. The three live users
  are separate: `file_serving.c` (entry above), and the `WSC_DBG` / `CL_DBG` debug `printf` macros in
  `ws_client.c:276` and `http_client.c:354`.

## Forty-six comments in `src/` name a `.cpp` file that no longer exists

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 reconciling SWEEP_NOTES.md against the tree.
- **Symptom:** `src/` is C: 349 `.c`, 378 `.h`, zero `.cpp`. 46 comments still point at the old
  names - `bignum.h:48` "see pc_bignum.cpp", `md.h:27` "md.cpp", `presentation.h:14`
  "http_parser.h / http_parser.cpp", `ssh_flow_control.h:13` "ssh_channel.cpp held the counters",
  `websocket.c:459` "lowlevel_recv_cb() (tcp.cpp)", `aes256ctr.h:56` "the mode ssh_packet.cpp uses",
  and 40 more. Every path names a file that cannot be opened.
- **Root cause:** the `.cpp` -> `.c` conversion renamed files and left the prose. `check_comments.py`
  already owns the "a sentence about code that is no longer there" family but matches on phrasing,
  not on whether a path in a comment resolves.
- **Fix:** not written. Rewrite the 46 references, and add a rule to `check_comments.py` that resolves
  any `<name>.<ext>` token in a comment against the tree - mechanical, and it cannot regress after.

## `pc_frame_append` re-scans the whole accumulated document on every call

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 reconciling SWEEP_NOTES.md against the tree.
- **Symptom:** `frame.c:115` is `size_t used = proto_scan_nul(out, cap);` on entry. Appending n
  fragments walks the document n times, so the three emitters that build an array in a loop are
  O(n^2) in document length: `dashboard.c:130-169`, `gpio_map.c:67-80`,
  `partition_monitor.c:99-113`.
- **Root cause:** the append takes only `(out, cap)`, so the length it needs is not in the signature
  and has to be recovered by scanning. `pc_frame_vbuild` returns the length it wrote, so the caller
  already holds the number the scan re-derives.
- **Partial mitigation, not a fix:** `proto_scan_nul` is the SWAR scan and tests four bytes per
  iteration rather than one. That is a constant factor on a quadratic.
- **Fix:** not written. The append takes the current length as an in/out parameter and returns the
  new one; the scan goes. Touches the three emitters and any other `pc_frame_append` caller.

## `PC_PLAINTEXT_ARENA_SIZE` is guessed twelve times, and scaled by the wrong quantity

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 reconciling SWEEP_NOTES.md against the tree.
- **Symptom:** the arena size is a `#ifndef` default in `protocore_config.h:6469` (8192) and again in
  all eleven `core_setup/board_profiles/esp/*_defaults.h`, scaled by die RAM: c2/c61/h2/h21/s2 8192,
  c3/c5/c6/h4 10240, s3/s31 12288, p4 16384.
- **Root cause:** the scaling axis is wrong. The requirement is set by which features are compiled
  in, not by which chip runs them - a C2 running SSH plus websocket borrows exactly what a P4 running
  SSH plus websocket borrows. `core_setup/board_profiles/derived_sizing.h` states that principle in
  its own header for `RX_BUF_SIZE` and the plaintext pool never got it.
- **What is already in place:** the per-TU worst-case terms exist and are proved at their borrow
  sites - `PC_PLAINTEXT_WORK_WS_SEND` / `_WS_RECV` (`websocket.h:76,84`), `_SSH_TRANSPORT`
  (`ssh_packet.h:197`), `_OIDC` (`oidc.h:58`), `_DIAG` (`protocore.c:757`). Each is `static_assert`ed
  against the arena individually. The arena is not derived from them.
- **Consequence today is silent:** a borrow past the guess returns NULL and the call site falls
  through to a degraded path (websocket sends uncompressed), so no peer, log line or test shows it.
- **Fix:** not written. The arena becomes the max over the declared `PC_PLAINTEXT_WORK_*` terms -
  max, not sum, because the arena resets per dispatch - taken in `protocore_config.h`, which is the
  only file that sees them all. The eleven board-profile defaults then delete, and
  `pc_plaintext_alloc`'s NULL return becomes unreachable.

## The portable DNS resolve spins on a blocking loop that pumps a listener it does not own

- **Status:** OPEN, found 2026-08-08 removing the UDP send rings.
- **Symptom:** `dns_resolver.c:432` waits for its answer in
  `while (!s_dr.done && (int32_t)(deadline - pc_millis()) > 0) { Udp.listener->poll(); pcdelay(5); }`.
  A resolve issued from inside a UDP handler never sees its reply and always returns false after the
  full `PC_DNS_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- **Root cause:** two faults in one loop. `poll_all()` sets `s_lst.polling` for its duration and
  returns immediately on a reentrant call, so a resolve called from inside a handler polls nothing
  for every iteration of the wait. And the listener pump belongs to `session.c`, which calls it from
  worker 0; reaching into it here drains every bound port's ring and runs every other service's
  handler from inside a DNS call.
- **Also blocking, same shape:** `dns_resolver.c:303` (vendor arm, `pcdelay` only),
  `tcp_client.c:268` (connect wait), and the `tls.c` handshake waits at `:915`, `:954`, `:977`.
- **Fix:** not written. The shape it takes: every TU that needs a delay owns one module-wide timer
  and never sleeps. A call enters, the functional block sits behind the timer, and
  `if (now - tu_timer >= delay)` clears busy and runs it; otherwise the call returns busy and the
  caller comes back on its own tick. Busy is marked on the TX side only, so RX stays open and the
  reply handler always runs. `resolve()` collapses to one entry point returning READY / BUSY /
  FAILED, which is the shape `ntp_service.h` already states ("Returns immediately; the first sync
  arrives asynchronously") and the shape lwIP's `ERR_INPROGRESS` uses.
- **Blast radius:** one contract change across `dns_resolver.{h,c}` (both arms), `tcp_client.c`
  (`pc_client_open` blocks on DNS then on connect), `edge_cache_proxy.c:163/211/229`, the AdsClient
  example, and `test_dns_resolver` / `test_client`. It converts as one piece: `resolve()` moving
  from `proto_bool` to an enum silently inverts `if (!resolve(...))` at `tcp_client.c:250`.

## Deflate and Inflate bind their namespace instance below the gate that declares its type

- **Status:** FIXED, found 2026-08-08 running the envs behind the `PC_HAS_BUS` batch. Pre-existing
  on `main`: `94c236e9` without the batch gives the identical four errors.
- **Symptom:** `pio test -e native_swar` ERRORS in the compile stage. `deflate.c:297: unknown type
name 'DeflateNs'` and `'deflate_raw' undeclared here (not in a function)`, and the same pair for
  `InflateNs` / `inflate_raw` at `inflate.c:455`.
- **Root cause:** both headers declare the namespace type and its `extern` inside
  `#if PC_ENABLE_WS_DEFLATE` (`deflate.h:67-74`, `inflate.h:35-71`), and both sources close that
  same gate before defining the instance: `deflate.c:295` is `#endif // PC_ENABLE_WS_DEFLATE` and
  the definition sits at `:297`, one line past it. With the feature off the type is not in scope but
  the definition is still compiled, and `native_swar` is an env that builds the codec with
  `PC_ENABLE_WS_DEFLATE` off.
- **Fix:** the definition moves above the `#endif` in both files, so the instance is inside the gate
  that declares what it is. This is the same shape as `radio_power.c`, where six entry points bound
  outside their gate.
- **What it uncovered:** `native_swar` still fails, now at the link rather than the compile, on
  `pc_aesgcm_key_init` / `pc_aesgcm_key_wipe` / `pc_aesgcm_seal` out of `ssh_conn.c`, `ssh_dh.c` and
  `ssh_packet.c`, plus `bn_expmod_group14`. That is the entry below, and it is why the compile error
  had been sitting there: nothing downstream of it had ever run.

## An env with no source list builds the whole of src/ and links none of core_setup/

- **Status:** FIXED for `native_swar`, found 2026-08-08 behind the `Deflate` / `Inflate` gate fix
  above. The general question the last bullet raises is still open.
- **Symptom:** `pio test -e native_swar` fails at the link with undefined references to
  `pc_aesgcm_key_init`, `pc_aesgcm_key_wipe`, `pc_aesgcm_seal` and `bn_expmod_group14`, out of
  translation units the suite has nothing to do with. `test_swar` covers `mmgr/swar.h`, which is
  header-only lane math.
- **Root cause:** `test/test_matrix.json` gives `native_swar` `"src": []` and `"flags": []`, so
  `gen_test_envs.py` emits no `build_src_filter` and PlatformIO falls back to its default of `+<*>`:
  the env compiles every file under `src/`. With no flags, every `PC_ENABLE_*` takes its default, so
  SSH is on and `ssh_conn.c` / `ssh_dh.c` / `ssh_packet.c` compile for real. The AEAD and bignum
  backends they call live under `core_setup/hal/portable`, which sits outside `src/` and so is in no
  env's default filter. Same family as the `native_quic_server` entry below: an env whose source set
  does not close over what its sources call.
- **Scope:** 25 of the 328 envs carry `"src": []` (`native_application`, `native_auth`,
  `native_base64`, `native_swar`, `native_transport` and 20 more). Most pass, because their `flags`
  turn the heavy features off before those files compile to anything. `native_swar` has an empty
  `flags` list as well, which is what makes it the one that links the whole default feature set.
- **Fix:** `native_swar` takes `"src": ["-<*>"]` and `"test_build_src": "no"`, which is what
  `native_concurrency` already uses for the same shape. `test_swar` covers `mmgr/swar.h`, which is
  header-only `static inline`, so the suite needs no library source at all and now builds none.
  (2026-08-08: the bounded scan it also covered moved to `mmgr/protostr.c` with the runops removal
  below, and its assertions went with it, so `native_swar` still links nothing.)
- **Still open:** whether an empty `src` should keep meaning "the whole tree". That default is what
  let this env silently acquire translation units it was never meant to build, and 24 other envs
  carry it. They pass only because their `flags` switch the heavy features off before those files
  compile to anything, which is a coincidence rather than a decision.

## test_ina219 asserts on INA219_REG_BUS_VOLTAGE, a name the library never defined

- **Status:** FIXED, found 2026-08-08 the same way. Pre-existing on `main`.
- **Symptom:** `pio test -e native_ina219` ERRORS in the compile stage:
  `test_ina219.c:72: 'INA219_REG_BUS_VOLTAGE' undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean
'INA219_REG_BUS'?`. The identifier appears nowhere else in the tree.
- **Root cause:** `ina219.h:34-39` names the register pair `INA219_REG_SHUNT` / `INA219_REG_BUS`,
  matching the doc comments ("shunt voltage" / "bus voltage"). `test_begin_and_read_drive_the_bus`
  spells the second one out in full. The reference is under no `#if`, so the env cannot compile at
  all.
- **Fix:** the test takes the name the library publishes. The header's pair is self-consistent and
  is what `ina219.c` reads, so the test was the side that was wrong.

## pc_server_reset() left the not-found handler installed, so no route miss ever answered 404

- **Status:** FIXED, found 2026-08-08 running the envs behind the `PC_HAS_BUS` batch. Pre-existing on
  `main`: `94c236e9` without the batch fails identically, and the other 36 envs in that run pass.
- **Symptom:** `pio test -e native_application` reports 96 cases, 2 failed.
  `test_empty_route_pattern_matches_nothing` (`:1873`) and `test_path_param_segment_mismatches`
  (`:1930`) both fail the same assertion, `strstr(tcp_captured(), "404")` returning NULL. The
  `TEST_ASSERT_FALSE(handler_called)` immediately above each one passes, so the matcher is refusing
  the route correctly and the response is what does not arrive.
- **What is ruled out:** the capture harness works. `:885` runs the identical
  `arm_slot` / `pcb` / `tcp_capture_reset` / `handle` / `strstr(out, "404")` sequence on
  `GET /nope.txt` and passes. Cross-test route pollution is ruled out too: `setUp` calls
  `pc_server_reset()` (`protocore.c:117`), which resets the route table, the mount points, the
  response headers, the middleware and the signal table.
- **Root cause:** `http.c:728` answers a route miss with `s_http.not_found` when one is set and the
  built-in 404 only when it is not. `pc_server_reset()` empties every other owner that holds an app
  registration - `HttpRoutes.reset()`, `Auth.reset()`, `pc_mnt_point_reset()`, `pc_resp_reset()`,
  `pc_middleware_reset()`, `pc_signal_reset()` - but HTTP's own `HttpCtx` was not among them, because
  HTTP was the one owner that never exposed a reset. Two tests near the top of the suite call
  `on_not_found()`, so from that point on every route miss in the binary ran their handler instead.
  The path had nothing to do with it; `GET /nope.txt` passed only because it runs before those two.
- **Fix:** `HttpNs` gains `reset`, which puts `HttpCtx` back to the blank template the same way
  `pc_server_reset()` does for its own `ServerCtx`, and `pc_server_reset()` calls it. That also
  clears the edge-cache poll seam, which had the same escape.

## native_quic_server does not link: it builds the HTTP/3 bridge without the HTTP or TCP owners

- **Status:** FIXED, found 2026-08-07 while yanking the host arms out of the presentation layer.
  Pre-existing and not caused by that sweep: building `ac33d37a0` (its base) gives the identical
  link errors.
- **Symptom:** `pio test -e native_quic_server` ERRORS in the link stage, before any test runs.
  `native_h3_server` builds the same file and passes.
- **Root cause:** the env's `src` list carries `presentation/http/http3/h3_server.c`, whose
  `pc_h3_resp_sink` and `pc_h3_server_request` reference `conn_pool`, `http_pool`, `http_reset`,
  `Tcp`, and `Http`. It carries neither the HTTP owner nor the TCP owner that define them, so
  `ld` reports eight undefined references out of `h3_server.o`.
- **Fix:** the env drops `h3_server.c` and tests `quic_server.c` alone. The dispatch bridge is what
  `native_h3_server` is for: it extends the full-app base, so the route table and the slot pools the
  bridge reaches are already in the image. The env now also carries the UDP listener, the client, the
  address mapping and `ip.c`, which is what `quic_server.c` binds its port through.

## pc_quic_server_stop() left the UDP port bound and its handler armed

- **Status:** FIXED, found 2026-08-07 while putting test_quic_server on the real listener.
- **Symptom:** none on a device, where the server is stopped once at most. A suite that stops and
  restarts saw the second `pc_quic_server_begin()` take `listen_on`'s already-bound path, which
  rebinds the handler without a fresh pcb.
- **Root cause:** `pc_quic_server_stop()` cleared the running flag, the pool and the ring cursors,
  but never called `Udp.listener->close()`, so the bind outlived the server it belonged to and a
  datagram arriving after the stop still filled the ingest ring. `quic_server.h` has documented the
  call as closing the binding since it was written.
- **Fix:** `pc_quic_server_stop()` closes the port first, before releasing the pool, so nothing more
  reaches the ring while it is being torn down.

## The TCP transport's hot path did not compile, and one env was the only witness

- **Status:** FIXED, found by running the transport envs during the ring work. Pre-existing on
  `c11-target`; confirmed by building `8b329ffd7` and getting the identical three errors.
- **Root cause:** three sites of namespace-conversion residue, all inside `#if PROTOCORE_HOT`.
  `worker.c` defines `pc_worker_wake` once in each build arm (`:129` under `PROTOCORE_HOT`, `:188`
  under `#else`) and `pc_defer` calls it at `:125`, above both. With no declaration in scope the
  call was an implicit non-static declaration, and the static definition below it then contradicted
  that. Separately, `tcp_conn.c:1156` and `tcp_listener.c:368` called `Session.workers->wake()`;
  `Session` is declared in `session.h`, which neither file includes. Both already include
  `worker.h`, whose only purpose is to export `Workers`.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `native_tcp_hot` is the only env that compiles the `PROTOCORE_HOT`
  arms of the transport. It runs on the host - `native_hot_base` sets `PROTOCORE_HOT` and the board
  mocks stand in for silicon - but every other env takes the `#else` arm, where the offending call
  sites do not exist, so 19 of the 20 SSH and transport envs were green with the hot path broken.
- **Fix:** a forward declaration above both arms in `worker.c`, so one declaration covers both
  definitions; and `Workers.wake()` at the call sites, which is the owner they already hold the
  header for rather than a reach up through the join and back down.
- **A third site the compiler never named:** `tcp_listener.c:351` had the same
  `Session.workers->wake()`, under `#if PC_WORKER_COUNT > 1` inside `#if PROTOCORE_HOT`.
  `native_tcp_hot` builds single-worker so it took the `#else` arm, and the two envs that do set
  `-DPC_WORKER_COUNT=2` do not set `PROTOCORE_HOT`. **`PROTOCORE_HOT` with `PC_WORKER_COUNT > 1` is
  compiled by nothing in the matrix**, so that arm was carrying the same break with no witness at
  all. Fixed the same way. The gap is closable on the host - `native_hot_base` with
  `-DPC_WORKER_COUNT=2` - and is still open.
- **A second gap the matrix already names:** `native_workers` records that per-worker queue routing
  is "hardware-verified (the host queue mock ignores the handle)". `pc_platform_queue_send` in
  `test/mocks/pc_net_host.h` discards the item and reports success, and the receive drains a
  separately staged buffer, so no host env can observe an enqueue reaching its consumer. That is
  what makes the enqueue-then-wake pair untestable here.
- **Still wrong, and not fixed here:** the call is upward whichever table it names. The worker
  blocks on a task notification (`worker_task`: `pc_platform_task_wait`), not on the queue it
  drains, so every producer does `pc_platform_queue_send()` and then a separate wake - and it is
  that second act that makes layer 4 name layer 5. Three of the four wake sites are literally an
  enqueue followed by a wake on the next line.

## The OAuth2 form-body builder took the address of its own parameter, and every token request crashed

- **Status:** FIXED, found while building the codec conversion. Pre-existing; not caused by that work.
- **Root cause:** `put_param` (`oauth2.c:77`) receives a `Buf *b` and then passed `&b` to `put_raw`
  and `put_enc`, which take a `Buf *`. That is a `Buf **`, so the callee read the stack slot holding
  the pointer as though it were the struct: `b->o` came out as whatever the adjacent stack held, and
  the first `b->o[b->n++] = *s` wrote through it. `native_oauth2` did not fail a case, it took
  SIGSEGV. All four calls at `:79-82` were wrong.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the compiler did emit `-Wincompatible-pointer-types` on every one of the
  four, which is a warning rather than an error in this build, and the suite ERRORs rather than
  FAILs on a signal, so a summary line reading `0 succeeded` never named a case.
- **Related:** the invariant comment at `:89` argues `b->n < b->cap` holds "for as long as b->ok
  remains true". That argument was sound for the functions themselves and said nothing about the
  caller passing the wrong level of indirection.
- **Fix:** pass `b`. The four calls now match the declarations.

---

## base64.h declared a C API with no C linkage, so every C++ caller asked the linker for a mangled name

- **Status:** FIXED, found during the presentation-layer namespace conversion.
- **Root cause:** `base64.h` carried no `PROTO_BEGIN_DECLS` / `PROTO_END_DECLS`. It was the only
  header under `presentation/codec/` missing them; the other eight all have the pair. `base64.c`
  compiles as C and emits `pc_base64_encode`, while a C++ translation unit that included the header
  read the declarations as C++ and asked for the Itanium-mangled spelling.
- **Who reached it:** `performance_benching/network_drivers/presentation/base64/src/main.cpp` and
  `host.cpp` both include it directly, as does the ota_service bench. Every `src/` caller is C, which
  is why no library build ever showed it.
- **Fix:** added the pair, and the `shared_primitives/types.h` include that defines it. The module's
  four functions are now `static` behind `Base64`, so the object is the only symbol crossing the
  boundary, and a `const` object at namespace scope is unmangled under the Itanium ABI either way.

---

## A robotics Read indexes past the axis array, in the exact state a test sets up

- **Status:** OPEN, found by the fieldbus audit. Verified in source.
- **Root cause:** `decode_axis` (`robotics.c:111`) bounds `k` by `axis_count` and nothing else. The
  Browse path adds `&& a <= PC_ROBOTICS_AXES` at `:357`; the Read path at `:210` does not, and then
  takes `&mds->device.axes[k - 1]` on an array declared `axes[PC_ROBOTICS_AXES]` (6). A caller that
  declares `axis_count = 7` and reads axis 7 reads `axes[6]`, one past the end.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `test_robotics.c:407` is named
  `test_browse_axes_clamped_to_compiled_maximum` and sets `axis_count = PC_ROBOTICS_AXES + 1`, which
  is precisely the state that triggers it, but exercises only Browse. The Read path in that state is
  untested.
- **Fix:** not applied.

---

## The umati enumerations do not match the companion spec, and the tests compare them to themselves

- **Status:** OPEN, found by the fieldbus audit.
- **Root cause:** OPC 40501-1 section 12.5 defines `OperationalMode` as Manual=0, Automatic=1,
  Setup=2, AutoWithManualIntervention=3, Service=4, Other=5. `umati.h:58` has OTHER=0, MANUAL=1,
  MDA=2, AUTOMATIC=3, SETUP=4: every value differs, and MDA is not in the spec at all. `ChannelState`
  is wrong the same way against section 12.1 (Active=0, Interrupted=1, Reset=2). `umati.h:56` claims
  the values follow the companion spec.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `test_umati.c:194` and `:197` assert the enumerator against itself, so
  no value is ever pinned to the document.
- **Same shape elsewhere in the group:** `test_iccp.c:51` pins `0x17` for a timestamp where
  `utc-time [17] IMPLICIT` is `0x91` and eight octets, not four; `:62` uses `0xA3` for RealQ against
  `0xA2` for StateQ at `:39`, though both are structures and cannot differ. `test_mms.c:47` pins a
  bare `0x1A` inside `name [0] ObjectName` where the ASN.1 requires `0x80`, `0xA1{...}` or `0x82`.
- **Fix:** none applied.

---

## The SunSpec suite would pass with the byte order reversed

- **Status:** OPEN, found by the fieldbus audit.
- **Root cause:** no big-endian 16-bit register is pinned anywhere in `test_sunspec.c`, on either
  side. The 32-bit paths are pinned, but `be16` and `write_u16` meet only each other: the truncation
  case returns false under either order, and the end-of-model marker `0xFFFF` is a palindrome. A
  symmetric swap in `sunspec.c:14` and `:137` passes the whole suite.
- **Also open in the same group:** the GOOSE Reserved1 simulation bit is hardcoded to zero
  (`goose.c:204`) so a simulated frame is indistinguishable to a subscriber; the GOOSE Length field
  is never validated and VLAN-tagged frames, the normal on-wire form, are rejected (`goose.c:226`);
  the BACnet Forwarded-NPDU returns the six-octet originating address as the head of the NPDU
  (`bacnet.c:35`); and the EUROMAP 77 namespace URI is the pre-harmonization `euromap.org` form
  rather than OPC 40077's.
- **Fix:** none applied.

---

## Four length fields off the wire wrap on a 32-bit target and pass their own bounds check

- **Status:** OPEN, found across the protocol audits. One class, four sites.
- **Symptom:** a peer-supplied length near `UINT32_MAX` makes the guard compute a small total, the
  check passes, and the parser hands back a multi-gigabyte span into a small buffer.
- **The sites:**
    - `vxi11.c:89` - `pad = (4 - (len & 3)) & 3` then `r->off + len + pad > r->len`. With `len`
      0xFFFFFFFD or above, `len + pad` wraps to 0 and `pc_vxi11_parse_read_resp` returns a ~4 GB
      `data_len`. Reachable from a device reply (RFC 4506 section 4.10 makes the opaque length a
      wire-supplied unsigned int).
    - `lsv2.c:90` - `size_t total = PC_LSV2_HEADER_LEN + plen` with `plen` raw off the wire. At
      0xFFFFFFF9 and above, `total` wraps to 1..7, `len < total` is false, and the telegram is
      accepted with a payload length up to 4 GB.
    - `wal.c:112` - `off + WAL_RECORD_HEADER + plen > len`, then `crc32_step(crc, r + 20, plen)`.
      Same shape at `wal_store.c:273` and `dbm.c:129`.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `size_t` is 64-bit on the host, so no host suite can reach any of them.
  The targets that matter (ESP32, Cortex-M, C2000) are all 32-bit.
- **Fix:** none applied.

---

## Two NMEA 2000 decoders return a not-available sentinel as a real measurement

- **Status:** OPEN, found by the timing and positioning audit.
- **Root cause:** `nmea2000.c:389` decodes `offset_m` with no validity check, so the
  not-available `0x7FFF` reads back as +32.767 m of depth offset. `:403` has the same defect on
  `deviation_rad` and `variation_rad`, where `0x7FFF` becomes +3.2767 rad.
- **Also in the same cluster:** `ntrip_caster.c:134` `pc_ntrip_request_parse` dereferences `out`
  through `memset` with no null guard, where every sibling parser guards; and
  `rtcm3.c:154` `pc_rtcm3_frame_build` with a null payload and a non-zero length skips the copy and
  CRCs uninitialized bytes, where `pc_ubx_build` refuses the same call.
- **Fix:** none applied.

---

## A test overflows its own signature buffer before the length guard runs

- **Status:** OPEN, found by the crypto audit.
- **Root cause:** `test_crypto_kat.c:301` decodes into `uint8_t sig[64]` and only then checks
  `slen != 64`. Five pinned Ed25519 vectors carry longer signatures, including tcId 34 at 96 bytes,
  which overruns by 32. Undefined behavior that ASan would trip.
- **Related, same suite:** the AES-128-GCM table is 40 rows and every one is `result: valid`. The
  curator's `flagged[:40]` cap consumes exactly the valid rows and truncates immediately before the
  first `ModifiedTag`, so `KatAead.valid` is emitted and never read. The file header claims
  "adversarial edge cases: wrong tags, modified IVs"; for AES-128-GCM there are none of either, and
  the only negative is the test's own tag flip.
- **Fix:** none applied. `sig[96]` closes the overflow; the coverage gap needs the cap raised or the
  buckets split.

---

## Every OAuth2 request builder passes a Buf ** where a Buf * is expected, and segfaults

- **Status:** OPEN, found by a spec audit of the security services. Verified in source.
- **Symptom:** `pc_oauth2_build_code_request()` and `pc_oauth2_build_refresh_request()` crash. Every
  parameter goes through the broken helper, so the first one does it.
- **Root cause:** `oauth2.c:77` takes `Buf *b` and then calls `put_raw(&b, "&")` at `:79`, `:80`,
  `:81` and `put_enc(&b, val)` at `:82`. `put_raw` and `put_enc` take `Buf *` (`:28`, `:48`), so each
  call passes the address of the pointer. The callee then treats a `Buf **` as a `Buf *` and writes
  through whatever the first members alias.
- **Why it compiles:** `-std=c11` makes an incompatible pointer type a warning. This file was a
  `.cpp` until `667989ac9`, where the C++ compiler rejected it outright as an error; the conversion
  to C demoted it to a warning and it has been broken since.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `native_oauth2` builds and the suite passes, because no case calls a
  builder. `test_oauth2` covers the percent-encoder and the response parser only.
- **Fix:** not applied, by owner decision. It is `put_raw(b, ...)` four times.

---

## The forwarded-client resolver reads the leftmost element, which is the one the client controls

- **Status:** OPEN, found in the same audit.
- **Symptom:** an auth lockout is evaded by rotating a header value, and any chosen address can be
  made to take the blame for another peer's failures.
- **Root cause:** `http_parser.c:789` returns the first element of `X-Forwarded-For`, and `:743`
  does the same for `Forwarded`. A proxy appends, so the element it added is the last one and
  everything left of it came from the client. RFC 7239 section 7.1 says only the element the trusted
  proxy added may be believed. The trust check still passes, because the peer genuinely is the
  proxy.
- **`http.c:538` states the opposite in a comment:** "a spoofed header can neither evade a lockout
  nor frame another address."
- **Why nothing caught it:** `test_http_parser.c:417`, `:422` and `:446` assert the leftmost element
  is what comes back, so the suite pins it. `test_forwarded_trust` never supplies a comma list at
  all, so the module that exists to stop this never sees the shape.
- **Fix:** not applied.

---

## pc_totp accepts digits = 0, and then every code verifies

- **Status:** OPEN, found in the same audit.
- **Root cause:** `totp.c:53` computes `pow10u(digits)` with no range check. At `digits = 0` the
  modulus is 1, so the generated code is always 0 and `pc_totp_verify()` accepts 0 from anyone. At
  `digits = 10` the value overflows `uint32_t`. RFC 4226 section 5.3 fixes the range at 6 to 8.
- **Related, same module:** the verifier is stateless, so a code stays valid for its whole window;
  RFC 6238 section 5.2 requires a used code to be refused. `pc_base32_decode` (`:147`) discards a
  trailing partial group instead of rejecting it, so two different secrets can decode to the same
  key, and it accepts `=` anywhere rather than only as trailing padding.
- **Why nothing caught it:** no case passes a `digits` outside 6 to 8, and none replays a code.
- **Fix:** not applied.

---

## Three writers discard a send result the caller is told succeeded

- **Status:** OPEN. `sse.c` found by the transport audit and verified; the pattern is the one
  BUGS.md already records under "TX truncation on large responses".
- **Root cause:** `sse.c:158` calls `Tcp.conn->send(...)` and returns `PROTO_TRUE` unconditionally.
  Once the TCP send buffer fills, the event is dropped and the subscriber is told it was delivered.
- **Also found, not send-related but the same class of unbuilt code:**
    - `udp_telemetry.c:206` names `s_ut.ip`; the member is `collector` (`:188`). It sits under
      `#if PROTOCORE_HOT`, which no host env compiles, so the file does not build for the target.
    - `sockpool.c:56` picks its LRU victim by comparing absolute `last_used` values with `<`, which
      inverts across a `millis()` rollover and evicts the newest slot. Every other window
      comparison in the tree uses an unsigned delta.
    - `udp_listener.c:498` (`listen_group`) omits the `find_bind(port)` rebind that `listen_on`
      carries at `:472` with a comment explaining why, so two slots can hold one port and one is
      unreachable.
- **Fix:** none applied.

---

## The accept path wires four callbacks and no test reads any of them

- **Status:** OPEN, found by the transport audit.
- **Symptom:** none locally. On target, deleting the wiring makes every accepted connection deaf to
  data, ACKs and errors, and the whole host suite stays green.
- **Root cause:** `tcp_listener.c:527` registers `pc_net_on_recv`, `pc_net_on_sent` and
  `pc_net_on_err` on each accepted pcb. The mock stores all four. No test reads them, and the mock's
  own `pc_net_host_deliver()` and `pc_net_host_close_peer()`, which fire a callback through a pcb,
  have zero callers. Every TCP test calls `lowlevel_recv_cb` and friends directly.
  `test_transport.c:1373` is named `test_accept_cb_claims_slot_and_wires_connection` and asserts
  nine fields, none of them a callback.
- **The pattern to copy is one directory over:** `test_udp_hot.c:101` asserts `p->on_recv` and
  drives delivery through it.
- **Fix:** not applied.

---

## test_concurrency compiles no library source, and ring.h cites it as its proof

- **Status:** OPEN, found by the transport audit.
- **Root cause:** `native_concurrency` and `native_tsan` both declare `"src": ["-<*>"]` and
  `"test_build_src": "no"`, so no ProtoCore file is in either binary. The suite hand-rolls its own
  ring with plain assignments on `_Atomic size_t`, which are sequentially consistent. Production
  uses acquire/release through `PROTO_ATOMIC_LOAD` and `PROTO_ATOMIC_STORE` (`ring.h:50`, `:53`) and
  the `pc_ring_*` helpers, none of which are linked into that binary. Weakening the production
  ordering to relaxed leaves both envs green.
- **The citation is circular:** `ring.h:44` justifies its ordering by pointing at
  `test_spsc_ring_no_race`, the test that cannot reach it.
- **Also:** `test_state_handoff_no_race` discards its observation at `:122` and its only assertion
  restates the writer thread's last statement after a join, so it cannot fail.
- **Fix:** not applied.

---

## The QUIC server acknowledges every packet number it never received

- **Status:** OPEN, found by a spec audit of the QUIC engine against RFC 9000.
- **Symptom:** a peer that skips packet numbers to probe for this sees them acknowledged and is
  entitled to close the connection with PROTOCOL_VIOLATION (RFC 9000 section 21.4).
- **Root cause:** `quic_conn.c:452` builds every ACK as
  `pc_quic_build_ack(buf, cap, s->largest_rx, 0, s->largest_rx)`. Per section 19.3.1 the smallest
  acknowledged is `largest - ack_range`, which is 0, so the frame claims one contiguous range from
  packet 0 upward. The engine drops undecryptable packets at `:396` and silently ignores
  out-of-window CRYPTO and STREAM data, so the claim is routinely false.
- **Why nothing caught it:** no test decodes the ACK range fields. The suites only assert that an
  ACK frame is present.
- **Fix:** not applied.

---

## Six QUIC and HTTP/3 conformance checks the RFC requires are absent

- **Status:** OPEN, found in the same audit. Grouped because each is one missing guard.
- **The set:**
    - The Fixed Bit (0x40) is never tested on either header form (`quic_packet.c:30` and `:85`).
      RFC 9000 section 17.2 requires a packet with it clear to be discarded.
    - An Initial carried in a datagram under 1200 bytes is accepted, and outbound ack-eliciting
      Initials are not padded to 1200. RFC 9000 section 14.1 requires both. `test_quic_server.c:517`
      builds a ~60-byte Initial and asserts it opens a connection, so the suite pins the gap.
    - Server-only transport parameters from a client are accepted (`quic_tp.c:127`, `:182`):
      original_destination_connection_id and retry_source_connection_id are applied,
      stateless_reset_token and preferred_address ignored. RFC 9000 section 18.2 requires
      TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR. This parser only ever runs server-side.
    - `initial_max_streams_*` has no 2^60 ceiling (`quic_tp.c:164`), against section 4.6.
    - An ACK whose first range exceeds the largest acknowledged is accepted (`quic_frame.c:42`); the
      parser skips ranges without computing them, so the negative-packet-number check section 19.3.1
      requires never runs.
    - SETTINGS identifier 0x00 is silently ignored (`h3_frame.c:93`), against RFC 9114 section
      7.2.4.1, which requires H3_SETTINGS_ERROR. The switch rejects 0x02 to 0x05 only.
    - The HTTP/3 control stream does not enforce SETTINGS-first, single-control-stream, or
      one-SETTINGS-only (RFC 9114 section 6.2.1, 7.2.4). `test_h3_conn.c:502` asserts the opposite,
      that a GOAWAY arriving first is consumed and ignored.
- **Also:** `pc_quic_build_version_negotiation` has no caller. Sending a Version Negotiation packet
  is the server's obligation under RFC 9000 section 6.1; `quic_conn.c:325` drops unknown versions
  and its comment says version negotiation is a client concern, which is backwards.
- **Fix:** none applied.

---

## A secure-arena borrow in test_quic_crypto is marked and never released

- **Status:** OPEN, found in the same audit.
- **Root cause:** `test_quic_crypto.c:113` takes `size_t scope = pc_secure_mark();`, never uses the
  value and never calls `pc_secure_release(scope)`, while `pc_aes128_wants()` at `:118` borrows from
  the secure arena. The borrow is held for the life of the process, and the variable is an
  unused-variable warning.
- **Blast radius:** the test binary only.
- **Fix:** not applied.

---

## Content-Length wraps, so an oversized value frames a short body and desynchronizes the connection

- **Status:** OPEN, found by a spec audit of the HTTP/1.1 parser. Verified in source.
- **Symptom:** a request whose Content-Length exceeds the width of `size_t` is accepted with a
  wrapped length. The parser frames that many bytes, reports PARSE_COMPLETE, and leaves the rest in
  the ring, where it is read as the beginning of the next request. That is request smuggling.
- **Root cause:** `http_parser.c:380` accumulates `cl = cl * 10 + (*q - '0')` with no overflow
  check, and the value buffer holds up to `MAX_VAL_LEN - 1` digits. `Content-Length: 4294967301`
  wraps to 5 on the 32-bit target; `18446744073709551621` wraps to 5 on a 64-bit host. RFC 9112
  section 6.3 item 5 makes an invalid Content-Length an unrecoverable error requiring 400 and close.
- **Blast radius:** every HTTP listener, unauthenticated, first request.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the suites cover a non-digit value, an empty value, a leading `+`, and
  a conflicting duplicate, but never a value that overflows. The analogous overflow IS tested for
  Range at `test_range.c:195`, so the pattern was known and not applied here.
- **Fix:** not applied, by owner decision.

## A HEAD request with a Range header is answered 206 with a Content-Range

- **Status:** OPEN, found in the same audit.
- **Root cause:** RFC 9110 section 14.2: "A server MUST ignore a Range header field received with a
  request method that is unrecognized or for which range handling is not defined. For this
  specification, GET is the only method for which range handling is defined." HEAD with a Range must
  answer 200 with the full representation length.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `test_range.c:221` asserts the 206, the `Content-Range: bytes 0-3/20`
  and the `Content-Length: 4` as the expected result, so the suite pins the violation and a fix
  fails that test.
- **Fix:** not applied.

---

## A captured Digest Authorization header replays for the whole nonce lifetime

- **Status:** OPEN, found in the same audit.
- **Root cause:** the nonce is stateless (a timestamp plus a keyed MAC) and the client nonce count
  is not tracked, so nothing detects reuse. RFC 7616 section 3.4 says that if the same nc value is
  seen twice the request is a replay. The window is `PC_DIGEST_NONCE_LIFETIME_MS`, five minutes.
- **Why nothing caught it:** every case in `test_digest_auth` uses `nc=00000001`, and no test
  asserts either refusal or a deliberate decision to accept.
- **Related:** `test_digest_vectors` exists to be the independent oracle for the Digest chain, but
  the server's construction lives in a `static` function (`auth.c:408`) that no test can call, so
  the suite rebuilds the chain itself exactly as `test_digest_auth` does. Both pass if the server
  drops a field or changes a separator; only the SHA-256 primitive is genuinely pinned.
- **Fix:** not applied.

## One spoofed UDP datagram permanently tears down a DTLS association

- **Status:** OPEN, found by a spec audit of the DTLS layer against RFC 9147.
- **Symptom:** a CoAPS peer's connection dies and does not recover. The attacker needs no keys and no
  position in the flow, only the address pair.
- **Root cause:** `dtls_conn.c:567` answers any AEAD failure with `fail(c, ALERT_DECRYPT_ERROR)` and
  `DTLS_REC_STEP_FATAL`. RFC 9147 section 4.5.2 says the opposite: "invalid records SHOULD be
  silently discarded, thus preserving the association", and calls generating alerts "extremely
  susceptible to denial-of-service" and NOT RECOMMENDED over a datagram transport. The path is
  reachable from the only in-tree caller: `coaps.c:21` routes every datagram into
  `pc_dtls_conn_process` during the handshake, and `:45` routes any non-epoch-3 ciphertext there
  afterwards.
- **Why nothing caught it:** no case injects a tampered epoch-2 ciphertext into
  `pc_dtls_conn_process`. The sibling path is correct and is tested: `pc_dtls_conn_open_app`
  (`dtls_conn.c:763`) returns false without failing the association, covered at
  `test_dtls_conn.c:1642`. The record layer's own bad-MAC rejection is covered too. Only the
  connection layer's reaction to it is not.
- **Fix:** not applied, by owner decision.

---

## The DTLS record layer rejects a legacy_record_version the RFC says to ignore

- **Status:** OPEN, found in the same audit.
- **Root cause:** `dtls_record.c:118` drops any DTLSPlaintext whose version is not 0xFEFD. RFC 9147
  section 4 allows {254,255} on an initial ClientHello for compatibility and says the field "MUST be
  ignored for all purposes". A backward-compatible initial ClientHello is dropped. Separately, the
  `epoch` field is parsed at `:123` and never validated, so a plaintext record claiming epoch 7 is
  processed as if it claimed 0.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `test_dtls_record.c:207` and `:467` both assert the rejection, so the
  suite pins the non-conformance and a fix would fail those tests.
- **Fix:** not applied.

---

## SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS is accepted in any phase, which skips the key exchange entirely

- **Status:** OPEN, found by a spec audit of the SSH server against RFC 4253. Verified in source.
- **Symptom:** none observed. A peer reaches password authentication without a key exchange and
  without the host ever proving its key.
- **Root cause:** `ssh_server.c:146` handles `SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS` with no phase guard. `ssh_transport.c`
  defines `SSH_PHASE_NEWKEYS` and assigns it at `:1405`, and nothing in `src/` ever reads it. From
  `SSH_PHASE_KEXINIT`, one plaintext packet carrying the single byte 21 runs
  `ssh_newkeys_complete()` (`ssh_transport.c:1427`), which sets `enc_in`, clears `kex_active`, and
  moves the phase to `SSH_PHASE_SERVICE`. No KEX ran, so the key material is still zeroed; the
  receive path does not consult `ssh_keys[i].active`, and `SSH_CIPHER_AES256CTR` and
  `SSH_MAC_HMAC_SHA256` are both 0, so the connection proceeds under an all-zero key, IV and MAC
  key. `SERVICE_REQUEST` and `USERAUTH_REQUEST` then pass the phase checks that were supposed to
  stop exactly this.
- **Blast radius:** every SSH listener. Remote, pre-authentication, no credentials needed.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the guard on `SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST` (`ssh_server.c:168`) was added
  for this attack and its comment names it - "stops a client from jumping from DH_INIT straight to
  userauth in cleartext". `test_ssh_server.c:294` proves that guard works. `SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS` is
  dispatched in seven places across the suites and every one is in the correct phase, so the door
  beside the guarded one is never tried.
- **Fix:** not applied, by owner decision. The guard is to refuse `SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS` unless the phase
  is `SSH_PHASE_NEWKEYS`, plus a negative test for each of the earlier phases.

---

## The plaintext SSH receive path does not enforce the four-byte minimum padding

- **Status:** OPEN, found in the same audit.
- **Root cause:** `ssh_packet.c:707` (`ssh_recv_plain`) checks only `pad_len_byte >= pkt_len`. All
  four encrypted paths also check `pad_len_byte < 4`. RFC 4253 section 6 requires at least four
  bytes of padding, and the same path skips the block-size multiple rule.
- **Blast radius:** the pre-NEWKEYS path only, which is the unauthenticated one.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `test_ssh_server.c:591` exercises only the `pad >= pkt_len` branch on
  this path.
- **Fix:** not applied.

---

## The HTTP/2 engine accepts frames RFC 9113 requires it to reject

- **Status:** OPEN, found by a spec audit of `h2_conn.c` against RFC 9113.
- **Symptom:** none locally. Every case here is a peer-reachable frame the engine takes instead of
  answering with the connection or stream error the RFC names.
- **The set, each with the clause it violates:**
    - RST_STREAM on stream 0 is accepted (`h2_conn.c:316`). Sec 6.4 makes it a connection error,
      PROTOCOL_ERROR. `test_h2_conn.c:767` asserts the acceptance, so the suite pins the violation.
    - DATA on a stream that was never opened is accepted and handed to the application
      (`h2_conn.c:203`, no state check). Sec 5.1 makes any non-HEADERS/PRIORITY frame on an idle
      stream a connection error. `test_h2_conn.c:791` asserts the acceptance.
    - WINDOW_UPDATE with a zero increment is accepted (`h2_conn.c:290`). Sec 6.9 makes it a stream
      error, or a connection error on stream 0.
    - WINDOW_UPDATE overflows the window rather than raising FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR (`h2_conn.c:298`
      and `:305`). Sec 6.9.1 caps a window at 2^31-1. `send_window` starts at the peer's declared
      `initial_window_size`, so a peer that declares 2^31-1 overflows a signed int32 with a single
      increment of 1, which is undefined behavior on a remotely supplied value.
    - The stream identifier on SETTINGS, PING and GOAWAY is never checked (`h2_conn.c:262`), against
      sec 6.5, 6.7 and 6.8. RST_STREAM, PRIORITY and GOAWAY lengths are never checked, against
      sec 6.4 and 6.3.
    - Send-side flow control is accounted and never consulted (`h2_conn.c:471`), so a body past the
      65535-byte connection window ships anyway, against sec 6.9.1.
    - A second HEADERS on an open stream is rejected as a connection error (`h2_conn.c:156`), which
      makes trailers (sec 8.1) unusable. Sec 5.1.1's ascending-id rule governs newly opened streams.
    - No request-validity checking at all (sec 8.2.2, 8.3.1): the mandatory pseudo-headers are not
      required and the connection-specific header fields are not banned, and `h2_server.c:107` copies
      any name and value straight into `HttpReq::headers`.
- **Fix:** not applied. Each is a separate guard and two of them require deleting a test assertion
  that currently pins the wrong behavior.

---

## The HTTP/2 request bridge collapses N streams onto one request, and no env builds it

- **Status:** OPEN, found in the same audit.
- **Symptom:** two concurrent HTTP/2 streams on one connection answer the wrong stream, or one
  request is lost. Not observed, because nothing exercises it.
- **Root cause:** `h2_conn` carries `PC_H2_MAX_STREAMS` concurrent streams (8, or 32 on the large
  PSRAM profiles). The bridge above it keeps one `HttpReq` per connection slot and one
  `conn_pool[slot].pc_h2_stream`, written at `h2_server.c:127` and read back by
  `pc_h2_server_respond()` at `:176`. A second stream's HEADERS overwrites both before the first is
  dispatched. `cb_data` (`:135`) also discards the stream id entirely, so with the idle-stream defect
  above a peer can append bytes to whatever request is being assembled.
- **Blast radius:** every concurrent HTTP/2 request. Multiplexing is the reason HTTP/2 exists.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `h2_server.c` is built by no test environment. It is recorded in
  `tools/ci_tooling/check/check_test_coverage_baseline.json` as knowingly uncovered, and its only exercise
  is the hardware-rig interop probe in `test/servers/`. Its HTTP/3 counterpart, `h3_server.c`, is
  built by two envs. `pc_h2_server_data()` also sends GOAWAY on a recv failure and returns with the
  socket still open, and the hand-rolled content-length parse at `:115` accepts a partial value and
  has no overflow guard.
- **Fix:** not applied. The bridge needs per-stream request state before the guards above are worth
  adding, so this is a design change rather than a patch.

---

## Two includes in protocore.c were gated on a flag their callers do not carry

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-06), found auditing the include block after the dispatch-chain move.
- **Symptom:** none in any env the matrix builds today, because no env sets `PC_ENABLE_HTTP3` or a
  nonzero `PC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` or `PC_ENABLE_HTTP_DELIVERY` with `PC_ENABLE_AUTH` off. Any build
  that does fails to compile on an implicit declaration.
- **Root cause:** `server/clock/clock.h` and `http_delivery.h` sat inside `#if PC_ENABLE_AUTH`. Their
  callers are elsewhere: `pc_millis()` runs the QUIC poll under `PC_ENABLE_HTTP3` and the request
  timeout under `PC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`, and `pc_delivery_cache_control()` runs under
  `PC_ENABLE_HTTP_DELIVERY` alone. An include nested under a flag it does not belong to reads as
  correct as long as one flag implies the other in every configuration anyone has built.
- **Fix:** `clock.h` is unconditional and `http_delivery.h` takes its own `PC_ENABLE_HTTP_DELIVERY`
  guard. `sha1.h`, `base64.h` and `sha256.h` came out with them: nothing in the file names a symbol
  from any of the three.

---

## Moving a function out of a file left its `#if` behind

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-06), found on the first build after the dispatch chain moved to
  `presentation/http/http.c`.
- **Symptom:** `native_application` fails to compile with `'Auth' undeclared`, `'HttpRoute' has no
member named 'auth_id'`, and `'CSRF_TOKEN_BUF' undeclared`.
- **Root cause:** the extraction script took each function's body and the comment block above it,
  but not the `#if` on the line before that, and not the `#endif` after. `pc_csrf_gate`,
  `handle_ws_route`, `proto_authorize_request`, `lockout_client_ip` and `send_too_many_requests`
  arrived in the new file unguarded, while `protocore.c` kept four `#if`/`#endif` pairs with nothing
  between them. Every call site was still guarded, so the guards read as intact.
- **Blast radius:** any build with the moved feature off, which is every env except the ones that
  set the matching flag.
- **Fix:** the four guards are restored around the functions in `http.c`, the empty pairs are gone
  from `protocore.c`, and the CSRF, lockout and forwarded-trust includes moved with the code that
  names them.

---

## Every id table a route indexes grew forever, because only the route table had a reset

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-06), found with the route-table fix above, which unblocked the suites.
- **Symptom:** `test_auth` passes its early cases and fails its late ones. `test_application` serves
  a static file in one case and 404s the identical setup two cases later. Nothing distinguishes a
  passing case from a failing one except how many ran before it.
- **Root cause:** a route stores an id naming a row in another module's table, and `add()` returns
  the row index. `pc_server_reset()` emptied the route table and left every one of those tables
  full. `Auth` and the mount registry both cap at `MAX_ROUTES`, so once the count reached it
  `Auth.add()` returned `PC_AUTH_NONE` and `pc_mnt_point_add()` returned `PC_MNT_NONE`. A route that
  holds those answers dispatches unguarded and serves nothing, silently, and both are the
  fail-open direction.
- **Blast radius:** any long-lived server that re-registers its routes, and every test suite that
  registers more than `MAX_ROUTES` protected routes or mounts across its cases.
- **Fix:** `Auth` publishes a `reset`, `mnt.c` publishes `pc_mnt_point_reset()`, and
  `pc_server_reset()` calls both beside `network.route->reset()`. An id is a row index, so the
  tables empty with the routes that index them.

---

## Two long-lived tables borrowed from a pool sized only for crypto working sets

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-06), found while chasing the `test_auth` failures above.
- **Symptom:** in `native_auth`, `Auth.add()` returns `PC_AUTH_NONE` for the first credential set
  ever registered, so every protected route dispatches unguarded. 17 of 23 cases fail.
- **Root cause:** `PC_SECURE_ARENA_SIZE` is the sum of the `PC_WORK_*` terms a build compiles, and
  `protocore_config.h` states the rule that every borrow declares one, proved by a `static_assert`
  in the owning module. `route.c` and `auth.c` both borrow from the pool and neither declared a
  term. Measured under `native_auth`: the arena is 1664 bytes (bignum 1408 + 256 round-up), the
  route table is 1416 and the credential table 1569. The route table binds first and leaves 248,
  so the credential table never binds.
- **Both were also on the wrong end of the arena.** `pc_secure_span()` bumps down from the scratch
  end, which `mark` walks and `release` reclaims. Both tables are held for the life of the program.
- **Fix:** `secure.h` publishes `pc_secure_persist_span()`, over the arena's persistent end, which
  no mark reaches and which hands back zeroed bytes. Both tables take it, `PC_WORK_ROUTE_TABLE` and
  `PC_WORK_AUTH_TABLE` join `PC_SECURE_ARENA_SIZE`, and each module `static_assert`s its struct
  against its term.

---

## The route table borrowed its storage from an init nothing called, so every route registration failed

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-06), found on the first matrix run that could link `native_keepalive`.
- **Symptom:** `on_http("/res", ...)` registers nothing. Every request answers 404 and no handler
  fires, while the keep-alive machinery around it behaves correctly, because a 404 is a normal
  response that keeps the connection alive. Four `test_keepalive` cases fail on the response body and
  the handler tally; the ones that only assert the Connection header pass.
- **Root cause:** moving the route table into the secure pool (3ef5c5a50) replaced its BSS with a
  borrow taken in a new `HttpRouteNs::init`, and no caller anywhere in `src/` calls it. BSS needed no
  init, so nothing existed to update. `s_route` stays NULL, `add()` returns NULL on its first guard,
  and every registration path drops the route it was handed. `pc_server_reset()` calls
  `network.route->reset()`, which is also a no-op on a NULL handle, so the table reads empty and
  consistent at every seam.
- **Blast radius:** every HTTP, WebSocket, SSE, file-serving and WebDAV route in the library. The
  envs that would have caught it were the ones failing to link for unrelated reasons, so it stayed
  invisible from 2026-08-05 until those were fixed.
- **Fix:** the borrow moves into a `bind_route()` taken on first use, the shape `auth.c` already
  uses for the same reason, and `init` leaves `HttpRouteNs`. A registration is the first thing that
  touches the table and every reader runs after one, so there is no moment a caller has to remember.

---

## The tcp_evt.h split cut 24 test suites off from tcp.h

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-05), found on a full-matrix run.
- **Symptom:** `ConnState`, `TcpConn`, `conn_pool` and `CONN_*` come out undeclared in a test that
  changed nothing. `native_accept_gate`, `native_presentation` and `native_session` fail to build.
- **Root cause:** `TcpEvt` and `EvtType` moved out of `tcp.h` into their own `tcp_evt.h`, and
  `presentation.h`, `session.h` and `listener.h` each narrowed their include to the new header,
  which is what they need. The slot types stayed in `tcp.h`. 24 white-box suites named the slot
  types while including only a layer header, so they were reaching `tcp.h` transitively and lost it
  the moment the layer stopped needing it.
- **Fix:** each of the 24 suites includes `network_drivers/transport/tcp.h` for the names it uses.
  The layer headers keep the narrow include.
- **Note:** only three of the 24 had been reached when the run stopped, so the count is what the
  symbol sweep found, not what the run reported.

---

## frame.c calls proto_scan_nul without including runops.h

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-05), found on the same run.
- **Symptom:** `native_scp` and `native_ssh_sftp` fail at link with `undefined reference to
'proto_scan_nul'`, preceded by an implicit-declaration warning at `src/mmgr/protoframe.c:113`.
- **Root cause:** `pc_frame_append` calls `proto_scan_nul`, which is a `static inline` in
  `shared_primitives/runops.h`, and `protoframe.c` includes only `mmgr/protoframe.h` and
  `shared_primitives/speed_opt.h`. Under C99 rules the implicit declaration makes it an external
  call to a name no TU defines, so it survives compilation and dies at link. Every other env that
  builds `frame.c` also builds a TU that pulls `runops.h` in ahead of it, which is why only the two
  filesystem-application envs showed it.
- **Fix:** `frame.c` includes `shared_primitives/runops.h`. (2026-08-08: that header is gone and the
  include is now `mmgr/protostr.h` - see the entry below.)

---

## The native base flags defeat PROTOCORE_HOT_FORCE, so the target path had no test env

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-05), found while adding the first env that builds the target path.
- **Symptom:** a native env that adds `-DPROTOCORE_HOT_FORCE` still compiles the host path.
  `PC_VENDOR_MOCK` comes out 1 and `PROTOCORE_HOT` comes out 0 at the same time, which the
  platform header states is impossible ("exact complements, there is no third"). No diagnostic:
  the env builds and its tests pass, against the wrong arm.
- **Root cause:** two sources of truth for one macro. `pc_platform.h` derives `PROTOCORE_HOST` from
  the vendor axis, defining it only in the else-arm reached when no vendor matched, and
  `PROTOCORE_HOT_FORCE` selects `PC_VENDOR_MOCK` in the arm above it. But `gen_test_envs.py` also
  passed `-DPROTOCORE_HOST=1` in the flags every native env extends. The command-line define wins:
  the guard that would have set it is skipped, `#ifndef PROTOCORE_HOST` then finds it already
  defined, and `#if PROTOCORE_HOST` selects the host path under a mock vendor. The vendor axis
  cannot override a value handed to it from outside, and `#undef` is banned (SRC_LAW rule 11), so
  no arrangement inside the header could have recovered.
- **Blast radius:** every one of the 310 native envs carried the flag, and the whole
  `PROTOCORE_HOT` half of the tree had no test env at all - `core_setup/*/mock/` exists to stand
  in for silicon and nothing was compiling against it. That is how the `pc_lwip_to_ip` bug above
  survived: its arm was unreachable from the suite.
- **Fix:** drop `-DPROTOCORE_HOST=1` from `native_base`. It was redundant - nothing on a native
  build matches a vendor, so the else-arm defines it anyway - and dropping it makes the vendor axis
  the only decider. A new `native_hot_base` extends the base with `-DPROTOCORE_HOT_FORCE`, and an
  env opts in with `"base": "native_hot_base"`.
- **Verified:** only 4 files under `src/` read `PROTOCORE_HOST` and each includes the platform
  chain in its first 40 lines; nothing in `test/mocks` or `test/support` reads it. The first env on
  the new base (`native_udp_hot`) carries `#error` on `!PROTOCORE_HOT`, so the fallback cannot
  return silently.

---

## pc_lwip_to_ip reverses the octets on the mock arm

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-05), found while giving UDP a wire layout built on `pc_ip`.
- **Symptom:** `pc_conn_remote_addr()` and the accept-callback address both report `5.0.0.10` where
  the peer is `10.0.0.5`, on any build that selects `PC_VENDOR_MOCK` (`-DPROTOCORE_HOT_FORCE`). No
  host suite catches it because the non-hot arm returns `PC_IP_NONE` and never reaches the mapping.
- **Root cause:** the two backends disagree on what `pc_net_ip4_u32` returns. lwIP's
  `ip4_addr_get_u32` hands back the stored `u32_t`, whose **memory bytes** are the network octets.
  The mock (`test/mocks/pc_net_host.h:730`) instead composes a **numeric** value,
  `bytes[0]<<24 | bytes[1]<<16 | bytes[2]<<8 | bytes[3]`. On a little-endian host those are byte
  reversed. `pc_lwip_to_ip` (`src/network_drivers/transport/tcp.c:915`) peels with
  `(uint8_t)be, (uint8_t)(be >> 8), ...`, which is right for lwIP on a little-endian target and
  backwards for the mock.
- **Second defect in the same three lines:** that peel is itself endianness-dependent. lwIP's value
  is network order in memory, so on a big-endian target the first octet is the high byte and the
  same code reverses there too. The portable read is of the u32's bytes, not of its value.
- **Blast radius:** `pc_net_ip4_u32` has two other callers that compare or return the value
  opaquely (`listener.c:486` interface tagging, `tcp.c:890` `pc_conn_remote_ip`), so changing the
  mock to match lwIP moves those too and needs its own verification pass.
- **Fix:** the mock returns the u32 lwIP does (the four bytes copied, not composed arithmetically),
  and the mapping moved out of `tcp.c` into `network_drivers/transport/net_addr.c` as
  `NetAddr.to_ip()`, where it reads the word's bytes instead of shifting its value and is therefore
  correct on either endianness. TCP needed it on accept and on the per-slot accessor and UDP needs
  it per received datagram, so one owner sits beside both rather than inside either.
- **Verified:** `10.0.0.5`, `192.168.4.1`, `224.0.0.251`, `255.254.253.252` round-trip through
  `NetAddr.to_ip()` and back out of `Ip.format()` unchanged on the mock arm; a null source leaves
  the out-param `PC_IP_NONE` rather than stale. Still to re-run: `native_tcp`, the listener suites,
  and `test_iface` (which asserts on `pc_ap_ip`, the value `listener.c` compares against).

---

## test_coaps segfaults after its last test passes

- **Status:** OPEN (found 2026-08-05, by the first clean run of the whole native matrix).
- **Symptom:** `native_coaps` reports all six tests PASSED and then dies with SIGSEGV, so the env
  is recorded ERRORED and the suite's result is discarded. The crash is after
  `test_coaps_forwards_handshake` returns, not inside any test body.
- **What is known:** the tests themselves pass, so it is a teardown or exit-path fault rather than
  a wrong assertion. `native_coaps_server` separately fails three tests
  (`test_server_single_peer`, `test_two_peers_routing`, `test_cid_address_migration`), which may or
  may not share a cause.
- **Not yet attributed:** it appeared in the first full-matrix run that completed, and earlier runs
  of that matrix were invalid (they defaulted to the `esp32dev` env and errored all 315 suites), so
  there is no clean before-state to compare against. It has NOT been shown to predate the bus-owner
  or toolchain work, and it has not been shown to be caused by it either.
- **Next step:** run `native_coaps` under gdb or valgrind for the faulting frame, then bisect
  against the merge-base if the frame does not name the cause.

## The peripheral drivers returned their host stub while the bus owners ran for real

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-05). Found by the end-to-end wire suite: every driver call returned
  false on host while the owners themselves worked.
- **Root cause:** the bus owners (`i2c.h`, `spi.h`, `uart.h`) were changed to key their real arm off
  `PC_PLATFORM_HAS_BUS` so a host build with the test seam drives the capture. The thirteen drivers
  that sit on them still split on `#if PROTOCORE_HOT`, so each took its own refusing stub and never
  composed a byte. The owner worked and the driver above it did not.
- **What it hid:** the interesting half of every driver - which bytes it composes, in what order, to
  which address - was unreachable on host, so it was asserted only by reading the code.
- **Fix:** the same `PROTOCORE_HOT || PC_PLATFORM_HAS_BUS` condition on all thirteen drivers.

---

## pcdelay spun forever on a host clock nothing advanced

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-05). Found while making the drivers' real body reachable on host.
- **Symptom:** latent until then. `pcdelay`'s host arm spun on `pc_millis()`, and the host virtual
  clock only moves when a test calls `set_millis`, so any wait with a non-zero argument never
  terminated. Nothing had reached it because the host arm of every driver refused before delaying.
- **Root cause:** the host arm was written as a bare spin on the assumption that only device code
  paths call it. Making the drivers real broke that assumption - `pc_pca9685_begin` waits 500 us for
  the oscillator and `pc_sht3x_read` waits 20 ms for a measurement.
- **Fix:** the host arm makes the same one-tick `pc_platform_task_delay(1)` hand-off the RTOS arm
  does, and the host mock advances its virtual clock there. The microsecond source also advances one
  per read, so a sub-millisecond settle terminates and its elapsed time is deterministic.

## Every OIDC token verification leaked four scratch borrows, and the arena never came back

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-03). Found by running `native_oidc` for the first time: the suite had
  not compiled since the C conversion, so nothing had executed `pc_oidc_verify_with_key` at all.
- **Symptom:** every verify returned `PC_OIDC_ERR_FORMAT` (-1), including a valid, correctly-signed
  token that should have returned 0. Twelve of the suite's tests failed with the same code whatever
  they were actually testing, because the failure happened before any of their input was examined.
- **Root cause:** `pc_oidc_verify_with_key` borrows four buffers from the plaintext arena (header,
  signature, payload, issuer - about 2.6 KB together, hoisted off the worker stack). The C++ version
  scoped them with a `PlaintextScope` whose destructor released on every return path. The conversion
  deleted the guard and did not replace it with a `pc_plaintext_mark()` / `pc_plaintext_release()`
  pair, so **every call leaked all four borrows**. The comment above the allocation still said
  "PlaintextScope reclaims them on every return path", which is how it read as correct.
- **What it does on a device:** the arena is a fixed per-worker pool reset per dispatch, so a single
  verification inside one dispatch still fits. Across the test binary the borrows accumulate until
  the arena cannot satisfy the next request, and from that point `!hdr || !sig || !pl || !iss` is
  true and every token is rejected as malformed - a fail-closed authentication outage that no input
  can clear. The same exhaustion is reachable on a target wherever more than one verify runs before
  the arena is reset.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the suite did not compile, so it never ran. `check_src_banned` does not
  model borrow/release pairing, and the leak is invisible to a reader because the comment describes
  the guard that used to be there.
- **Fix:** `size_t scope = pc_plaintext_mark();` before the first borrow, and
  `pc_plaintext_release(scope);` on each of the eleven returns after it. The two early returns above
  the mark (null token, `split3` failure) borrow nothing and are unchanged. Comment rewritten to
  describe what the code does now.
- **Worth auditing:** this is the same shape as the 17 `PlaintextScope` / `SecureScope` guards
  already converted by hand in `src/`, and the two in `test_plaintext` / `test_secure_pool` that had
  lost their release. Any other site where a deleted guard left a borrow unpaired has the same
  failure mode and the same invisibility.

## The C11 conversion never covered the PROTOCORE_HOT path, and pc_mnt_backend has no sync

- **Status:** OPEN (2026-08-03). Found by grepping `src/` for C++ constructs after the native compile
  sweep came back clean on the files it can reach.
- **Symptom:** `src/` is C11 only on the paths a native env compiles. Everything behind
  `#if PROTOCORE_HOT` is still C++, and no native env compiles it, so 307 envs of compile sweep
  cannot see any of it. Found: `namespace fs { class FS; }` plus `fs::FS &` parameters in
  `server/exc_decoder.h` / `server/exc_coredump.c`, `namespace fs` and `fs::FS *` / `fs::File &` in
  `core_setup/hal/esp/esp_mnt_fs.{h,c}`, and a whole `namespace pc_wal_fs_detail` over `fs::File`
  in `services/storage/wal/wal_fs.h`. A target build of any of them is a hard C error.
- **Root cause:** the conversion was driven by the native suites, which are the only thing that
  compiles during it. `PROTOCORE_HOT` is false on the host, so those regions were never parsed.
- **Fixed here:** `pc_exc_coredump_save` now takes `const pc_mnt_backend *` and goes through the
  vtable, so `server/` names no vendor type; `exc_decoder.h` drops the `namespace fs` forward
  declaration.
- **Still open, and why:** `wal_fs.h` cannot be retargeted onto the seam as it stands. Its durability
  barrier is `File::flush()`, and **`pc_mnt_backend` has no sync/flush entry**. Translating it
  without one would leave `WalDev::sync` returning true having done nothing, which turns a
  power-loss-safe log into one that only looks safe. Adding `sync` to the vtable touches every
  backend (RAM disk, the ESP adapter, the lfs mock), so it is an owner decision rather than a
  mechanical fix.
- **Also open:** `esp_mnt_fs.{h,c}` legitimately names Arduino's `fs::FS` because wrapping it is the
  adapter's whole job. Resolved by compiling `core_setup/hal/esp/` as C++ (owner decision), which
  needs the build rule and a SYMBOLS.md amendment recording the exemption.

## A board profile's PC_GPIO_OUT macro rewrote the pc_gpio_dir enum member of the same name

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-03), pending a target build. Found by the full-tree compile sweep: an
  env that pulls in both the host net mock and `gpio_map.h` failed with
  `test/mocks/pc_net_host.h:214:20: error: expected identifier before numeric constant`.
- **Symptom:** two encodings of a pin direction shared four names. `pc_gpio_dir` declared
  `PC_GPIO_IN`, `PC_GPIO_IN_PULLUP`, `PC_GPIO_IN_PULLDOWN`, `PC_GPIO_OUT` as enum members numbered
  0/1/2/3 in that order; `board_profiles/pc_platform.h` (and the host mock beside it) `#define` the
  same four names as the pin-mode argument, numbered IN=0, OUT=1, PULLUP=2, PULLDOWN=3. Where both
  headers reach one translation unit the macro wins, because substitution happens before the
  compiler sees the declaration.
- **What it did on a target:** in `pc_gpio_begin_pins`, `case PC_GPIO_OUT:` became `case 1:`, which
  is the enum's `IN_PULLUP`. A pin mapped as an output has `dir == 3`, matches no case, and falls to
  the default arm, so it was configured as an **input**: a mapped LED or relay never drives. A pin
  mapped `IN_PULLUP` (`dir == 1`) took the OUT arm and was configured as an **output**, so the panel
  drove a pin wired to a button. `pc_gpio_is_output()` compared against the same rewritten constant,
  so the write route agreed with the wrong table.
- **Root cause:** exactly the failure docs/SYMBOLS.md section 2 describes. The enum member carried
  the bare subsystem prefix rather than its own type's, leaving it in the same token space as a macro
  the board layer had every right to define.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the two headers only meet in a host env that mocks the platform, and
  `native_gpio_map` was not one of them, so the enum was never parsed with the macro already
  defined. Where they did not meet, the enum spelled itself and every test passed. On a target the
  numbers silently disagree and nothing is diagnosed, because both sides are valid integers.
- **Fix:** the members take the type's own prefix: `PC_GPIO_DIR_IN`, `PC_GPIO_DIR_IN_PULLUP`,
  `PC_GPIO_DIR_IN_PULLDOWN`, `PC_GPIO_DIR_OUT` (`gpio_map.h`), so the case labels are the enum and
  the arguments to `pc_platform_gpio_mode()` stay the board profile's numbers. Call sites updated in
  `gpio_map.c`, `test_gpio_map.c` and the `GpioMap` example.

## HTTP/2 refuses an over-limit stream with a RST_STREAM naming stream 0

- **Status:** OPEN (2026-08-03). Found while converting `h2_conn`'s last lambda to a named function,
  which put the builder's arguments on their own line.
- **Symptom:** when the stream table is full, `handle_headers()` answers the new HEADERS with
  `pc_h2_build_rst_stream(b, cap, 0, 0)` - stream id 0, error code 0 - and keeps the connection.
  RFC 9113 sec 6.4 says a RST_STREAM with a stream identifier of 0x00 is a connection error of type
  PROTOCOL_ERROR, so a conforming peer must respond with GOAWAY and close. The refusal that was
  meant to shed one stream takes the whole connection down instead, and the error code says
  NO_ERROR rather than REFUSED_STREAM (0x07), which is what tells a client the request was not
  processed and is safe to retry elsewhere.
- **Root cause:** `send_control()` takes a `size_t (*)(uint8_t *, size_t)`, which carries no room
  for the stream id, so the call site passed the two constants the signature allowed.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `test_h2_stream_table_full_rst` asserts only that at least one
  RST_STREAM frame goes out, never which stream it names. No interop test drives the table to its
  limit.
- **Fix:** not yet applied - the refusal needs the stream id, so `send_control`'s builder signature
  has to carry it (or the refusal path builds its frame directly). Deliberately left alone during
  the C conversion, whose contract was to change no behavior.

## 51 helpers became global symbols when the C conversion deleted their anonymous namespace

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-02), pending a target build. Found by diffing `src/` against v0.0.1
  after `check_owned_context` reported four contexts with external linkage.
- **Symptom:** no diagnostic anywhere. Unprefixed names - `resolve`, `service`, `intern`, `peek`,
  `new_node`, `find_port`, `teardown`, `do_dns` - sat at global scope, and two of them collided
  outright: `s_ctx` was defined non-static in both `relay_listener.c` (`RelayListenerCtx`) and
  `iface_bridge_hw.c` (`BridgeGlueCtx`). Two external definitions of one name with different types
  is a duplicate symbol; a C tentative definition can also merge them, giving two unrelated
  subsystems one object sized to the larger and letting each scribble on the other's state.
- **Root cause:** v0.0.1 wrapped these in `namespace { ... }`, which is internal linkage. C has no
  anonymous namespace, so the conversion deleted the wrapper. Where it did not substitute `static`,
  the guarantee left with the construct. 156 files in 0.0.1 had an anonymous namespace; 8 still
  carried a symbol that lost its linkage, 51 symbols in total. `graphql.c`, `relay_listener.c` and
  `iface_bridge_hw.c` lost every symbol theirs held.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `check_owned_context` globbed `*.cpp` only, so after the conversion it
  read 51 of 351 implementation files and never saw any of these. Even once widened it reports the
  three contexts and not the 48 functions, because it checks file-scope mutables rather than
  linkage in general. `check_duplicate_symbols` misses `s_ctx` because it only reports a duplicate
  that some header also declares `extern`, and neither does. Nothing else reads linkage at all.
- **Fix:** `static` on all 51, verified against the diff as exactly 51 lines each unchanged except
  for a prepended `static`. This is the same defect a previous session fixed by hand in
  `crypto/pqc/sntrup761.c` using `nm` on the object file, which is the authoritative check and the
  one to repeat once the tree compiles.
- **Not affected:** the public API. `pc_gql_arg_*`, `pc_espnow_*` and their kind were declared
  outside the namespace in 0.0.1 and are correctly external.
- **Separately:** `check_owned_context` matched only the C++ spelling `thread_local`, so
  `static _Thread_local int t_worker_id` in `mmgr/arena.c` read as a loose global. The C11 spelling
  is now matched too; the variable was always correct.

## The theme-blob generator kept emitting C++, so CI resurrects a dead `binary_asset_blobs.cpp` on every run

- **Status:** OPEN (2026-08-02). Found by widening `check_duplicate_symbols` to `.c`, which it had
  stopped reading.
- **Symptom:** `PC_THEME_BLOBS` and `PC_THEME_BLOB_COUNT` are each defined in two tracked files,
  `binary_asset_blobs.c` and `binary_asset_blobs.cpp`. Any build that compiles the whole tree -
  Arduino, and the ESP-IDF component, whose `CMakeLists.txt` globs `src/*.c` and `src/*.cpp` -
  gets two definitions of both and fails to link. The native envs name their sources explicitly
  and reference neither file, so nothing in the test matrix sees it.
- **Root cause:** `web_assets/wizard/gen_theme_blobs.py` writes `BASENAME + ".cpp"` and renders
  `return nullptr;` with unbraced bodies. The C conversion produced the `.c` by hand-editing that
  generated output (`nullptr` -> `NULL`, braces added) and left the `.cpp` tracked. The generator
  was never converted with the tree, so `feature-tables.yml` re-runs it and `git add`s
  `binary_asset_blobs.cpp` explicitly - deleting the file by hand is undone by the next CI run.
  The `.cpp` is byte-identical to what the generator emits today, which is what identifies it as
  the live output and the `.c` as the hand-edited copy.
- **Why nothing caught it:** `check_duplicate_symbols` globbed `*.cpp` only, so after the
  conversion it compared 51 files out of 351 and could not see a `.c`/`.cpp` pair. It reported OK
  throughout. No native env compiles either file, and no target build runs in CI.
- **Fix:** the generator emits `.c` and emits C (`NULL`, braced bodies); `--check` now reproduces
  the committed `.c` byte for byte. `feature-tables.yml` and `.clang-format-ignore` follow the
  rename. The dead `binary_asset_blobs.cpp` still has to be deleted - pending, because deleting it
  before the generator fix landed would only have brought it back.

## `webdav.c` and `webdav.cpp` are two different modules sharing one name in one directory

- **Status:** OPEN (2026-08-02). Found alongside the `binary_asset_blobs` pair.
- **Symptom:** `src/network_drivers/application/webdav/` holds both `webdav.c` (the
  filesystem-backed half: PROPFIND/PUT/COPY/MOVE over a mounted subtree) and `webdav.cpp` (the
  pure core: method classification, header parsing, the 207 Multi-Status XML builder). They define
  different symbols, so this does not break the link, and both are live - the test matrix builds
  `webdav.c` in five envs and `webdav.cpp` in three, and one env builds both.
- **Root cause:** `bddf3f4a3` ("move each module under the layer that owns it") moved the
  filesystem half into the directory that already held the pure core. `webdav.c`'s own file
  comment still says the pure core "lives in network_drivers/application/webdav/", which is now
  the directory it is sitting in, so the comment reads as self-referential.
- **Why nothing caught it:** nothing checks for a basename collision across extensions, and the
  two files carry no duplicate symbol for `check_duplicate_symbols` to catch. Both compile.
- **Fix:** not yet decided. One of the two needs a name that says which half it is.

## `check_docs` stopped reading `src/*.c`, so 78 flags and 63 functions became invisible to it

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-02). Found while clearing the checker's one live finding, the stale
  `PC_DIAG_JSON` citation.
- **Symptom:** none yet. The next doc to cite a symbol that lives only in a `.c` file gets reported
  as a stale citation and fails CI, with the symbol sitting in the tree the whole time.
- **Root cause:** the checker builds its authority set - "does this symbol exist" - from
  `git ls-files src/*.h src/*.cpp test/*.h test/*.cpp penetration_testing/*.h penetration_testing/*.cpp`. That list
  was written when every implementation file was a `.cpp`. The C conversion left 576 `.c` files
  outside it, and with them 78 `PC_*` names and 63 `pc_*` functions that no longer appear anywhere
  the checker looks.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the gap only produces false positives, and only for a doc citing one
  of those 141 symbols in backticks. No current doc does, so the checker kept reporting OK while
  its authority set was a third of what it should be. A checker that is too strict fails visibly
  when it finally fires, but until then it looks identical to a correct one.
- **Fix:** add `*.c` to each of the three globs. The set is meant to answer whether a symbol exists
  in the tree, so it follows the file extensions the tree actually uses.

## Six `network_drivers` enums lost their declared width in the C conversion, growing every struct that holds one

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-08-02), pending a target build. Found by diffing `network_drivers/`
  against v0.0.1.
- **Symptom:** no failure and no diagnostic. `sizeof` grew on `TcpConn`, `TcpEvt` and `pc_ip`, so
  the static pools built from them grew with no source change naming a size.
- **Root cause:** `enum class X : uint8_t` states the width in the declaration. Rewriting it as a
  plain `typedef enum` drops that clause, and a C enum with no attribute is whatever the
  implementation picks, which is `int` on every target here. Six declarations lost it:
  `ConnState`, `EvtType` and `pc_conn_reason` in `transport/tcp.h`, `pc_ip_family` and
  `pc_ip_scope` in `network/ip.h`, and `pc_tcp_op` in `transport/tcp.c`. Three are stored rather
  than only passed, so each one multiplies: `TcpConn` holds `_Atomic ConnState state` and
  `conn_pool` is `TcpConn[CONN_POOL_SLOTS]`; `TcpEvt` holds `EvtType type` and every listener
  carries `_queue_storage[EVT_QUEUE_DEPTH * sizeof(TcpEvt)]`; `pc_ip` holds `pc_ip_family family`
  and is embedded wherever an address is stored. One byte to four, per instance, in the pools whose
  total is meant to be computable before flashing.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the width was never asserted anywhere. It lived only in the
  declaration, so removing the declaration removed the requirement with it, and nothing downstream
  reads a size it could disagree with. Every test still passes because no behavior depends on the
  width, only the footprint does.
- **Fix:** `PROTO_ENUM_PACKED` on all six. The attribute asks for the narrowest type the values fit,
  which is a byte for each of these, and `types.h` already proves the toolchain honors it with a
  `static_assert` on `proto_enum_probe`. `pc_phy_ps` in `physical/physical.h` was the same defect,
  found and fixed separately, which is what prompted pairing every `enum class X : T` in v0.0.1
  against its counterpart here: 34 enums carried a declared width, 6 had lost it.
- **Not affected:** `WsCloseCode` (`uint16_t` -> packed) still occupies two bytes because its values
  run 1000-4999 and packed widens to fit. `DeflateResult` and `InflateResult` (`int32_t` -> packed)
  narrow to a byte, and both are return values rather than stored fields. `CborType` and
  `MsgpackType` were folded into `pc_codec_type`, which is packed.

## A mount root without a trailing slash silently concatenates: `/gcode` + `/part.nc` -> `/gcodepart.nc`

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-31, host-validated). Pre-existing; found while moving the path join
  into `server/filesystem`.
- **Symptom:** an SFTP or SCP server started with a root that does not end in `/` writes every file
  to a path with the separator missing. `pc_ssh_sftp_begin(LittleFS, "/gcode")` plus a client
  request for `/part.nc` resolves to `/gcodepart.nc` - a sibling of the intended directory, not a
  file inside it. No error is reported at any layer; the transfer succeeds to the wrong path.
- **Root cause:** the join treats the mount root's trailing `/` as a known property and emits
  `root || sub` with no separator of its own, which is correct and is why there is no runtime test
  for it. Nothing established the property, though: the root arrived as a caller-supplied
  `const char *` stored as-is by `pc_ssh_sftp_begin` / `pc_ssh_scp_begin`, whose only normalization
  was `(root && root[0]) ? root : "/"`. `examples/L5-Session/SSHSftp/README.md:68` documents the
  broken form, so the recommended call was the failing one. The shipped example uses `"/"`, which
  happens to end in a slash, which is why HW validation never caught it.
- **Fix:** the accessor owns the root, so it is the one place that can make the shape true rather
  than assume it. `pc_fs_begin()` stores a normalized copy with the separator appended if absent;
  the join's assumption then holds by construction and still costs no runtime test. A root that
  does not fit is refused outright rather than truncated into a different directory.

## Every ESP32 example failed to link: `web_assets.cpp` was tracked twice under two names

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-31). Both changed sketches now build on the real core: Telnet 919,127 B
  (70%), WebTerminal 921,847 B (70%), `esp32:esp32:esp32s3` core 3.3.10.
- **Symptom:** every one of the 152 example sketches failed at link with
  `multiple definition of 'PC_DASHBOARD_PAGE'`, and the same for `PC_PROV_FORM`,
  `PC_PROV_SAVED_HTML`, `PC_TERMINAL_PAGE`, `PC_SERVICE_WORKER`, `PC_STATS_JSON`, `PC_METRICS_PROM`.
- **Root cause:** a now-deleted `web.cpp`, beside `web_assets.cpp` in `src/network_drivers/application/`, was a byte-identical copy of
  `web_assets.cpp`, and `web.h` was `web_assets.h` with only its include guard renamed - its file
  banner still read `@file web_assets.h`. Both were tracked. Arduino compiles every `.cpp` under a
  library's `src/`, so both copies were compiled and both defined the same symbols. They are
  `const`, which is internal linkage in C++ and would have been harmless, but `web_assets.h`
  declares them `extern`, which makes them external and therefore a collision.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the native envs compile an **explicit source list** per env, so a file
  nobody lists is a file nobody builds - 5,780 host tests passed with the duplicate present. Only a
  whole-tree build reaches it. `check_examples.py` reads sketch source for API misuse and never
  links. Worse, the file had already been _touched_ by a green commit: "fix the web.h guard" made
  the duplicate's include guard unique, which is what a linter asks for and the exact opposite of
  what the file needed.
- **Fix:** deleted `web.cpp` and `web.h`. `web_assets.*` is the generated pair
  (`web_assets/wizard/build_assets.py` emits it) and all six consumers already included
  `web_assets.h`; nothing included `web.h`, not even `web.cpp`.
- **Gate:** `tools/ci_tooling/check/check_duplicate_symbols.py`, wired into CI. It reports a file-scope
  variable defined in two `.cpp` files, but only when the definition actually carries external
  linkage - non-`const`, or `const` with an `extern` declaration in a header. That distinction is
  load-bearing: without it the check flags the four codecs that each define their own
  `const DIST_BASE[]` / `LEN_BASE[]`, which never collide because a file-scope `const` is internal
  linkage in C++. Proven by restoring the duplicate and watching all 7 symbols report.

## The banned-construct gate was a no-op on Windows: its baseline keys carried the host's path separator

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-31). `check_src_banned.py --all` on Windows now reports
  `971 known ratcheted site(s) remain, 16 fixed`, matching Linux.
- **Symptom:** running the gate locally on Windows reported **every** recorded site as a brand-new
  violation - 987 of them - so the output read as "the sweep has regressed catastrophically" rather
  than "the tool cannot find its baseline." CI on Linux passed the whole time.
- **Root cause:** `_key()` built its baseline key from `str(path)`, and `--all` collects through
  `pathlib.Path.rglob`, which yields a `WindowsPath`. So the scanner produced
  `src\services\web\httpcache\httpcache.cpp|19|rev#1` while the committed baseline holds
  `src/services/web/httpcache/httpcache.cpp|19|rev#1`. Nothing matched, so nothing was ever
  recognized as known. The module already had a `_norm()` helper for exactly this, but only
  `collect()` used it.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the baseline is a _committed_ file compared against a _host-generated_
  key, and only one of the two platforms that reads it runs in CI. A ratchet that silently stops
  recognizing its own floor fails in the safe direction (it over-reports), which is why it survived -
  it never let a violation through, it just stopped being usable where the code is written.
- **Fix:** `_key()` normalizes the path before building the key. The gate is the same on both
  platforms now, which is the point of committing the baseline at all.

## AES-256-GCM ran 7.6x slow: we replaced the vendor's AEAD, then rebuilt its context per packet

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-31). Sealing 1 KiB on an S3: 616,567 -> **81,130** cyc. The raw vendor call
  is 81,104, so this is now at the toolchain ceiling. Native 267/267 across the affected envs; all four
  ESP32 examples build; measured on the COM3/COM4 S3 rig.
- **Symptom:** none. Nothing failed and no test complained - `pc_aesgcm` was simply 7.6x slower than the
  same chip's own AES-GCM, and `docs/FEATURE_PERFORMANCE.md` recorded that as a property of the silicon.
- **Root cause 1 - a path that should not have existed.** `SOC_AES_SUPPORT_GCM` is unset for the S3, so
  the code concluded the die had no GCM and hand-rolled a replacement, driving the block cipher 16 bytes
  at a time with a software GHASH. The capability macro describes one mode of one peripheral; it is not a
  statement that no fast path exists. The vendor's implementation knows what its own silicon can do.
- **Root cause 2 - the api forced a context rebuild per record.** `pc_aesgcm_seal_tag()` took raw key
  bytes, so every packet stood an mbedtls GCM context up and tore it down: **9,221 cycles**, fixed
  regardless of message size. ~10% of a 1 KiB record, ~30% of a 256 B TLS record, and most of a small
  interactive SSH packet.
- **Why nothing caught it:** correctness tests cannot see it - the KATs passed the whole time, because a
  slow AEAD is still a correct AEAD. And the one micro-measurement that looks like it would catch root
  cause 2 actively hides it: `init+setkey+free` timed **alone** is 513 cycles, ~18x under the truth,
  because a loop that never encrypts never takes the AES peripheral. The cost only appears as
  acquire/use/release around real work.
- **Fix:** the AEAD moved to explicitly-selected backends under `core_setup/hal/` (vendor / portable,
  no weak symbol), and `pc_aesgcm` became keyed - `pc_aesgcm_key_init` once per key, seal/open per
  record, with the raw-key entry points deleted rather than kept as a shim so no caller can pay the
  lifecycle invisibly. SSH holds a context per direction in its keymat and now stores no raw GCM key at
  all; SMB/IKEv2/IPsec-ESP build one per call at the call site, where the cost is at least visible.
- **Ruled out by measurement** (recorded so it is not re-litigated): pointer alignment - context at pool
  align 8 = 81,102, align 32 = 81,085, stack local = 81,077, identical - and the pool itself, 849 cyc for
  borrow + wipe.
- **Found on the way:** the SSH round-trip test hand-populated `km->aes_key_*` instead of building a
  context. A zeroed GHASH table makes the tag a **constant**, so the round trip still passed while forged
  packets were accepted - the tamper assertion is what caught it. Shipping code was never affected (the
  KEX install path always builds the context), but it is a sharp edge worth knowing: an uninitialized
  AEAD context fails open, not closed.
- **Follow-ups CLOSED (same day).** `pc_quic_aes128_gcm` and `pc_dtls_record` carried the identical
  pair of errors and got the identical pair of fixes: **562,292 -> 80,361** (7.0x) and
  **578,730 -> 91,209** (6.3x). `crypto/aead/aes128gcm.cpp` had no vendor AEAD path at all, so it was
  deleted outright and replaced by esp/portable backends; the AES-128 block primitive (`pc_aes128`,
  QUIC header protection) went with it, leaving the core with declarations only. Four raw-key entry
  points collapsed to two keyed ones - attached-tag is just detached with `tag_out = ct_out + len`.
- **Two things this turned up that the first pass did not:**
    1. Removing the combined-length check from the AEAD moved a bounds obligation onto every caller.
       `pc_aes128gcm_open()` used to reject a buffer shorter than a tag; the detached api has no
       combined length to check, and QUIC's `ct_len` comes off the wire, so `ct_len - TAG_LEN` would
       have wrapped to a huge `size_t`. Explicit guards restored in both callers. DTLS was only
       accidentally safe - a wrapped length happened to fail a later `> out_cap` test.
    2. A silent no-op edit wrote a 176-byte key schedule into a 16-byte field. `clang-format` had
       reflowed the struct member, so a literal-string replacement missed it and - unlike the others -
       that one had no assertion. The RFC 9001 A.2 wire vector caught it. Every replacement asserts now.
- **A number I got wrong and corrected:** I first reported the header-protection context at ~8,400
  cycles. That micro-bench measured pool borrow + context build + one AES-128-ECB block. Split: block
  alone 7,842, so the context is **556** - which matches the observed ~560 improvement, where 8,400
  did not. Subtract the required work before crediting the wrapper.
- **Next target, found by that split:** one 16-byte AES-ECB block costs **7,842 cycles** (~490
  cycles/byte, against ~78 for the 1 KiB GCM beside it). A single hardware AES operation pays per-call
  setup a bulk operation amortizes. Header protection runs on every packet, so this is now the
  dominant per-packet cost on small QUIC/DTLS records - and software AES may beat the accelerator for
  one block. OPEN.
- **Lesson:** a benchmark is a correctness test for performance claims, and we had none for this - the
  7.6x sat in a doc as a fact about the chip for as long as nobody re-measured it.

## The whole LoRa driver was excluded from every build by a stale feature guard

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-30). `native_lora` 19/19, and the file now compiles into the S3 image.
- **Symptom:** an `arduino-cli` build of an unrelated sketch died on
  `services/radio/lora/lora.cpp:14: fatal error: services/lora/lora.h: No such file or directory`.
- **Root cause:** two independent misses in one file. The reorg moved LoRa to
  `services/radio/lora/` without updating that file's own `#include`, and the `dws_` -> `pc_`
  rename skipped the file entirely: 13 stale tokens, including its guard `#if DWS_ENABLE_LORA`.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the stale guard is never true, so the entire body of the file was
  preprocessed away in every configuration. A file that compiles to nothing compiles cleanly. The
  header had been renamed correctly, so `PC_ENABLE_LORA=1` would have compiled every `pc_lora_*`
  declaration and then failed to link a single definition - the feature was shipped-broken, and
  only the default of 0 hid it. The one line outside the guard was the `#include`, which is
  precisely why that is all the compiler ever complained about.
- **Fix:** correct the include path, rename all 13 tokens. Tree-wide `DWS_`/`DET_`/`dws_`/`detws_`
  count is now 0.
- **Lesson:** a feature disabled by default has no compile-time coverage at all, so a rename sweep
  measured by "does it still build" cannot see it. The check that would have caught this is that
  every quoted `#include` under `src/` resolves to a real file - that holds whether or not the
  code around it is enabled.

## A header used uint32_t without including stdint.h and only worked by accident

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-30). `native_primitives` 21/21 including four new `pc_sb` cases.
- **Symptom:** adding the first direct unit test of `shared_primitives/strbuf.h` failed to compile:
  `'uint32_t' was not declared in this scope`, pointing at a signature that had been there all along.
- **Root cause:** `strbuf.h` declared `pc_sb_u32(pc_sb *, uint32_t)` but included only `<stddef.h>`
  and `<string.h>`. Every file that included it happened to pull in `<stdint.h>` first, so the header
  was never compiled on its own and the missing include never showed.
- **Fix:** include `<stdint.h>` in the header that uses it.
- **Lesson:** "it compiles everywhere it is used" is not the same as "it compiles". A header is only
  self-contained if something includes it first, and nothing did until a test did.

## A tree-wide rename of a one-letter constant rewrote character literals, test vectors, and prose

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-30), same session. 489 corrupted sites reverted, 0 residue, 310/310 tests
  green on every suite that had been touched.
- **Symptom:** `src/network_drivers/application/smb/ntlmssp.c` stopped compiling with
  `narrowing conversion of 1346592592 from int to uint8_t`. 1346592592 is `'PC_P'` - a
  four-character literal - where the source had written `'P'`.
- **Root cause:** the rule-18 converter prefixes a converted constant and then renames that token
  across the tree. One of the constants was named `P` (an sntrup761 spec parameter). The rename used
  `(?<![\w])P\b`, and **quotes are not word characters**, so it matched inside literals and prose:
    - `{'N','T','L','M','S','S','P',0}` became `'PC_P'` - the NTLMSSP signature
    - NMEA test vectors `",12202.1236,W,1,08,"` became `,PC_W,` - silently changing what they assert
    - comments: `"Q-command codec"` -> `PC_Q-command`, `"single-bit R/W"` -> `R/PC_W`
- **Why the gates missed it:** a mangled character literal violates no naming rule, so check_symbols
  and check_src_banned were both green with `'PC_P'` in the source. **The compiler caught it** - the
  narrowing conversion. Types found what pattern matching could not.
- **Fix:** revert every `PC_<single char>` globally (no library macro is one character, so all of them
  were damage), and make the converter refuse to rename any name of 2 characters or fewer, printing
  why. The three sntrup761 parameters were then named by hand as `PC_SNTRUP_P/Q/W`, keeping the spec
  mapping in a comment - which also removes the `#define P 761` hazard that rewrites the token `P` in
  every header that translation unit includes (SYMBOLS.md s2's `OUTPUT` problem, exactly).
- **Lesson:** a tree-wide rename's safety is a property of the NAME, not of the tool. `EDGE_MESH_RESP_MAX`
  can be swept blind; `P` cannot, and no amount of care in the sweep fixes that - only refusing the
  input does.

## 130 of 152 example sketches could not be compiled: include order defeated Arduino's library discovery

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-30). HW-verified: `examples/Foundation/Basic` builds (908 KB flash / 41% RAM),
  flashes to an ESP32-S3, joins WiFi, and serves `GET /` with keep-alive plus the framework's automatic 404.
- **Symptom:** every affected sketch failed at the first line of the build, against a clean Arduino install:
  `fatal error: network_drivers/physical/physical.h: No such file or directory`.
- **Root cause:** Arduino resolves libraries by walking a sketch's `#include` directives and matching each
  against an installed library. `network_drivers/physical/physical.h` matches nothing until ProtoCore's
  `src/` is already on the include path, and the only include that puts it there is `protocore.h`. With
  the physical include first, the compile dies before the library is ever discovered. Alphabetical include
  order is what produced it (`n` sorts before `p`), so the house style caused the bug: this is the one
  place a sketch must not sort, because the header that identifies the library has to lead.
- **Why nothing caught it:** the native test suite compiles `src/` directly with explicit include paths, so
  it never exercises Arduino's library resolution. 5756 host tests passed against sketches that could not
  build. Only a real `arduino-cli compile` reaches this code path - which is exactly why the examples
  compile gate exists as its own task.
- **Fix:** `protocore.h` first in all 132 sketches (120 plain, 12 whose include carried a trailing comment).
  Twelve of them already carried the comment "library entry header (also sets the src/ include root)" - the
  reason was known and written down, and the order was still wrong. Documenting a constraint does not
  enforce it.

## 86 example READMEs teach the banned `WiFi.*` API that rule 6 forbids, and no guardrail scans them

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-30). 446 vendor calls and 144 bare enum members corrected across 83 READMEs
  plus the two esp-idf examples; guarded by `tools/ci_tooling/check/check_examples.py`, which reads sketches AND
  README fenced code. The guard was verified by injecting a regression and confirming a non-zero exit.
- **Second defect, found while writing the guard:** the enum-member harvester used a lazy `.*?` body match,
  so it mis-attributed members between enums and missed most of them entirely - it saw 376 members where
  the tree has 894. The first scoping pass therefore fixed 68 and silently left 76. Bounding the body with
  `[^{}]*` and stripping `#if` lines from it (enum bodies are conditionally compiled, so the flag names were
  being harvested as members) fixed both. The harvester now lives in `tools/ci_tooling/lib/src_symbols.py` so the
  sweep and the checker cannot disagree.

- **Symptom:** 86 of 154 `examples/**/README.md` teach `#include <WiFi.h>`, `WiFi.localIP()`, `WiFiClient`, or
  `WiFiUDP` in their annotated-source blocks, while **0 of the `.ino` sketches** use any of them. A beginner who
  follows a README instead of reading the sketch next to it writes exactly the code the library bans, and it
  will not link against the transport API the sketch actually uses.
- **Root cause:** two independent gaps that only bite together. (1) The sketches were migrated to the library
  transport (`pc_client_*` / `pc_udp_*` / `Physical.link->egress_ip()`), but the annotated-source blocks are
  hand-rolled on purpose - the heavy annotation is the teaching content and cannot be generated - so the
  migration updated the code and left 86 hand-written copies behind. (2) `docs/SRCBANNED.md` rule 6 explicitly
  states **"Applies to `examples/` too"** and even documents the check
  (`rg -n 'WiFiClient|WiFiUDP|AsyncUDP' src/ examples/`), but `tools/ci_tooling/check/check_src_banned.py` scans only `src/`,
  explicitly exempts `examples/`, and never scans markdown at all. The rule that would have caught this was
  written down and never enforced where it claimed to apply.
- **Second class, same cause:** 62 READMEs also use **unscoped enum members** - `server.on("/", HTTP_GET, h)`
  and `case HTTP_11:` - but `HttpMethod` is an `enum class` (src/protocore.h:76), so that code does not
  compile at all. Every sketch uses the scoped `HttpMethod::HTTP_GET` form (84 files); zero use the bare
  form. Same hand-rolled blocks, same migration, same drift.
- **Fix (planned):** correct both classes in place, preserving the surrounding annotation, and extend the
  guardrail to enforce rule 6 over `examples/` for both `.ino` and README fenced code, so the documented scope
  and the enforced scope finally match. The remaining bans stay `src/`-only per SRCBANNED.
- **Lesson:** a ban that names its own scope in prose is not enforced until a checker reads that scope. The
  hand-rolled annotation is worth keeping; what was missing is a check that lets it stay hand-rolled safely.

## SMB 3.x client couldn't reach a `smb encrypt = required` share; then AES-CCM in-place decrypt clobbered its own AAD/tag

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-27). HW-verified against a real Samba (RPi, `smb encrypt = required` share) with all
  four SMB 3.1.1 ciphers (AES-128/256-GCM, AES-128/256-CCM), each reading the share file byte-exact.
- **Symptom (1):** the encrypted-share probe failed at TREE_CONNECT with ACCESS_DENIED (0xc0000022). **Symptom
  (2), found while adding the other ciphers:** AES-CCM round-tripped in isolation (KAT + separate-buffer codec
  test) but failed end to end in the client (`smb_open` -> SMB_ERR_PROTOCOL), while GCM worked.
- **Root cause (1):** the NEGOTIATE request left the Capabilities field zero, so it never advertised
  `SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION` (MS-SMB2 §3.2.4.2.2.2). Samba then negotiated no cipher and rejected the
  unencrypted session. Additionally, a share-level (not global) `smb encrypt = required` does **not** set the
  session `SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_ENCRYPT_DATA`, so the client - which only encrypted when the server set that flag -
  never turned encryption on; it needs client-forced encryption (like smbclient `-e`, MS-SMB2 §3.2.4.1.5).
- **Root cause (2):** CCM is decrypt-then-MAC (unlike GCM, which verifies before producing plaintext), so
  `pc_aesccm_open_tag` reads the AAD and received tag **after** writing the recovered plaintext. The SMB codec
  decrypts **in place** (`rx -> rx`, a no-heap design GCM tolerated by read-before-write), so the plaintext
  overwrote the TRANSFORM_HEADER's AAD (`rx[20..51]`) and tag (`rx[4..19]`) before the MAC consumed them - it
  authenticated garbage and failed closed. Separate-buffer tests couldn't see it (no aliasing).
- **Fix:** (1) advertise `SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION` in NEGOTIATE and add `SmbConfig.encrypt` (client-forced
  encryption: activate once a cipher is negotiated, regardless of the server session flag). (2) `pc_smb2_decrypt`
  snapshots the 48 header bytes (AAD + tag) into locals before decrypting, making in-place decrypt correct for
  every cipher - the crypto primitive's contract is "out may alias the ciphertext", never the AAD/tag, so the
  codec that aliased the whole buffer is what must preserve them. Read the authoritative MS-SMB2 spec + the
  smbclient reference trace to get the negotiation right.
- **Also delivered:** AES-CCM (SP800-38C, 128/256) as a new `crypto/aesccm`, detached-tag AES-256-GCM in
  `crypto/aesgcm`, all four ciphers wired into the codec + negotiate + key derivation. KAT'd vs pyca/cryptography.

## pc_net_mac read all-zeros on an Ethernet-only device (no egress-interface MAC accessor)

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-26). Surfaced + validated on the ESP32-P4 (Ethernet, 192.168.1.153) and S3 (WiFi).
- **Symptom:** the physical (L1) link test printed `MAC=00:00:00:00:00:00` on the P4 - an Ethernet-only board
  whose PHY plainly has a MAC (`e8:f6:0a:e0:a7:8d`). The library exposed no way to read the active interface's
  hardware address.
- **Root cause:** `Physical.link->mac()` returns the WiFi _station_ MAC via `WiFi.macAddress()` (what ESP-NOW / WiFi
  diagnostics need), which reads back zeros when the WiFi driver was never started, as on the wired P4. It does
  exactly what it is documented to do; the real gap was the absence of an interface-neutral "MAC on the wire"
  accessor for the egress link. Not a regression - the physical-layer vendor-partition HW test just exposed it.
- **Fix:** added `Physical.link->egress_mac()` - reads the live default-route netif's `hwaddr` (lwIP), so it returns
  the Ethernet PHY's MAC on a wired link and the WiFi STA MAC on a wireless one, independent of which driver
  started; fallback stub on host / no-backend builds. Clarified `Physical.link->mac()`'s doc as WiFi-STA-specific and
  cross-referenced the new accessor. HW-verified: P4 `egress_mac=e8:f6:0a:e0:a7:8d` (with `wifi_sta_mac` zeros);
  S3 `egress_mac=94:a9:90:d1:7a:b8` == its `wifi_sta_mac` (WiFi is the egress there).

## Slow-loris held the connection pool indefinitely (slot-exhaustion DoS)

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-21). Reproduced and fixed on an ESP32-P4 (Ethernet, 192.168.1.153).
- **Symptom:** a slow-loris - open N connections, send `GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n`, then trickle one header line
  (`X-a: b\r\n`) every ~3 s and never terminate the headers - filled the entire fixed connection pool
  (`MAX_CONNS`) and denied it to legitimate clients **forever**. A `scratchpad/slowloris2.py` with 12 holders
  saw every legitimate probe DENIED (`ConnectionResetError`) with no recovery.
- **Root cause:** the only per-connection timeout was the idle sweep (`CONN_TIMEOUT_MS`, 5 s), and
  `last_activity_ms` is refreshed on **every accepted RX byte** (tcp.cpp, the recv handler). A trickle that
  drips a byte just under the idle window therefore keeps the idle timer alive indefinitely while never
  completing a request - so a partial request could hold a slot for as long as the attacker kept dripping.
  There was no deadline a trickle could not reset.
- **Fix:** a request-**header** read deadline - the nginx `client_header_timeout` semantic. A new per-slot
  `req_start_ms` is armed once, on the first RX byte of a request (tcp.cpp), and cannot be reset by later
  trickle bytes. The per-tick session poll (`http_poll_slot`) reaps any slot still in the **header** phase
  (`parse_state < PARSE_BODY`) past `PC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 10 s) with a `408 Request Timeout` +
  `Connection: close`, freeing the slot. It is scoped to the header phase, so a legitimate slow **body** upload
  (which sits in `PARSE_BODY` for its whole duration, governed by the streaming handler + idle timer) is never
  reaped; WebSocket / SSE slots are skipped by the poll before the check. `req_start_ms` is disarmed on request
  completion so a kept-alive connection re-arms per request.
- **Verified:** host - four reap tests in `test_dispatch` (reaped past deadline, survives before it, a
  completed slow request is not reaped, a `PARSE_BODY` upload is not reaped) plus the full transport/app/
  accept-gate/keepalive suites. HW (ESP32-P4) - the pool now **recovers**: probes DENIED at t=2/5/8 s (pool
  full), SERVED at t=11/14/17 s once the 10 s deadline reaps the holders; a threaded-trickle client (idle timer
  kept fresh) receives a real `HTTP/1.1 408 Request Timeout` at t=10.1 s, confirming the request deadline
  (not the 5 s idle sweep) is what fires; heap stable, no panic across the attack cycles.

## SSH algorithm negotiation used server preference, not client preference (RFC 4253 §7.1) - KEX reset vs CycloneSSH

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-20). Found by **real-peer interop**: the Oryx **CycloneSSH** client (a
  from-scratch second SSH stack) could not complete a handshake against our SSH server on an ESP32-P4 (COM9) -
  the server reset the TCP connection right after the client's `SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT`. OpenSSH (the 16/16
  algorithm matrix) never hit it because its modern defaults happen to match the order we advertise.
- **Symptom:** CycloneSSH negotiated curve25519-sha256 + ssh-ed25519 + chacha20-poly1305 (its own picks), sent
  a 32-byte curve25519 `KEX_ECDH_INIT`, and got a TCP RST with no `KEX_ECDH_REPLY`. Captured on the wire and
  reproduced deterministically by feeding the exact KEXINIT + init bytes through `ssh_kexinit_parse` →
  `ssh_kex_generate` → `ssh_kexdh_handle` in a host test (`ssh_kexdh_handle` returned -1).
- **Root cause:** `negotiate_alg` (ssh_transport.c) iterated the SERVER's candidate list and picked the first
  name the client also offered - **server preference**. RFC 4253 §7.1 mandates **client preference**: "iterate
  over the client's algorithms ... choose the first the server also supports." When the server holds an RSA
  host key, its `prefer_rsa` ordering ranks ecdh-sha2-nistp256 + rsa-sha2-512 above curve25519 + ssh-ed25519,
  so a client that lists curve25519/ed25519 first made the two sides **negotiate different algorithms**: the
  server chose nistp256 and expected a 65-byte init, the client sent a 32-byte curve25519 init,
  `parse_ecdh_init_p256` rejected it (`n != 65`), and `ssh_kexdh_handle` returned -1 → RST. OpenSSH advertises
  its algorithms in the same PQC/curve-first order we do, so it always guessed our top pick and never diverged;
  a differently-ordered implementation was required to expose it. The same server-preference applied to
  cipher/MAC/compression (they happened to agree only because the top choices matched).
- **Fix:** `negotiate_alg` now iterates the **client's** name-list in order and takes the first name any
  available server candidate matches (RFC 4253 §7.1 client preference) - for KEX, host key, cipher, MAC, and
  compression. Host-tested (`native_ssh` 196/196, incl. a new client-preference cipher test and a regression
  that drives the exact captured CycloneSSH bytes) and **HW-verified on the ESP32-P4**: CycloneSSH now
  completes the full KEX + auth + a byte-exact encrypted-channel echo, and OpenSSH is unaffected.

## `tcp_recved` on a freed pcb - remotely-triggerable reboot under SSH connection churn (DoS)

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-20). Found by **stress-testing the live SSH server on an ESP32-P4** (COM9) with
  the pentest tool's new SSH DoS attacks (`ssh_conn_saturation` / `ssh_slowloris` / `ssh_handshake_flood`)
  plus concurrent sntrup761 handshakes killed mid-flight and rapid connect/RST churn.
- **Symptom:** under connection churn the device rebooted (`rst:0xc (SW_CPU_RESET)`) with any of three
  panics - `assert failed: tcp_output ... (tcp_output: invalid pcb)`, `assert failed: tcp_update_rcv_ann_wnd
... (new_rcv_ann_wnd <= 0xffff)`, or `Guru Meditation Error: Load access fault`. A remote peer could reboot
  the server at will by opening SSH connections and resetting them mid-handshake - a denial of service.
- **Root cause:** every socket op the worker marshals to `tcpip_thread` re-checks that the slot still owns
  the captured pcb before touching lwIP (`k->pcb == conn_pool[slot].pcb`, since a remote RST frees the pcb via
  the error callback between capture and execution) - **except `PC_OP_RECVED`**, which called
  `tcp_recved(k->pcb, k->len)` unguarded (`tcp.cpp`). The RX-ack path (`pc_conn_ack_consumed`) checks the pcb
  worker-side, but the marshaled `tcp_recved` runs later; if the connection was torn down in between,
  `tcp_recved` walks a freed pcb - `tcp_update_rcv_ann_wnd` (window assert) and, when reopening the window,
  a window-update `tcp_output` (`invalid pcb`) - which is why one hole produced all three signatures. A serial
  `esp_rom_printf` trace confirmed every _guarded_ `tcp_output` ran on an ESTABLISHED pcb (`state==4`), so the
  crash was not at any guarded send site - it was the unguarded receive-ack.
- **Fix:** guard `PC_OP_RECVED` with the same O(1) liveness check as `PC_OP_SEND`/`PC_OP_OUTPUT` - skip
  `tcp_recved` (return `ERR_CLSD`) when `k->pcb != conn_pool[slot].pcb`. Verified on HW: this **eliminates the
  `tcp_update_rcv_ann_wnd` assert** and the reboot on the targeted mid-flight-kill + connect/RST churn repro
  (0 reboots, heap flat ~282 KB). A **second, distinct** `tcp_output: invalid pcb` reboot remained under the
  broader DoS suite (`ssh_slowloris` / `ssh_handshake_flood`) - a **NULL-pcb** hole in the same guards, now
  also fixed; see the entry below.

---

## `tcp_output(NULL)` - a NULL pcb passes the liveness guard (SSH slow-loris / churn DoS)

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-20). A second, distinct remotely-triggerable reboot from the RECVED bug above;
  `assert failed: tcp_output ... invalid pcb` -> `rst:0xc (SW_CPU_RESET)`, ~26-36 reboots per high-intensity
  DoS run on an ESP32-P4.
- **Reliable repro (also the regression test):** `pc_pentest.py --only ssh_slowloris` - 8 half-open
  partial-banner connections (`"SSH-2.0-sl"` + a dribble of `.` bytes), refreshed ~19 s; also
  `ssh_handshake_flood`. Heap stays flat, so a use-after-free, not exhaustion.
- **Root cause (pinned by the flash coredump, NOT by guessing):** every worker-marshalled socket op guards
  `k->pcb == conn_pool[slot].pcb` (a stale pcb after a torn-down connection won't match the slot's live pcb).
  But the guard compared **pointers without a NULL test**. `pc_conn_flush()` marshals `PC_OP_OUTPUT` with
  `conn_pool[slot].pcb`, which is **NULL** for a slot that was torn down between the caller and the op - so a
  captured-NULL vs a live-NULL (`NULL == NULL`) **passed** the guard and called `tcp_output(NULL)` -> lwIP's
  "invalid pcb" panic. The `esp_coredump` backtrace showed exactly this: frame `pc_tcp_do` `tcp.cpp:297`
  (`PC_OP_OUTPUT`) with `k->op=PC_OP_OUTPUT, k->slot=0, k->pcb=0x0, conn_pool[0].pcb=0x0, state=CONN_FREE`.
  An earlier `esp_rom_printf` trace had wrongly ruled this path out (it only ever printed the _non-NULL_
  survivors), which is why the coredump was decisive.
- **Fix:** add the null test to the `PC_OP_SEND` / `PC_OP_OUTPUT` / `PC_OP_RECVED` guards -
  `k->pcb && k->pcb == conn_pool[slot].pcb` (SEND: `!k->pcb || k->pcb != ...`). A captured-NULL now skips
  (`ERR_CLSD`) instead of calling `tcp_output`/`tcp_write`/`tcp_recved(NULL)`. **HW-verified on the P4:** the
  full DoS suite that rebooted it 26-36x now runs **3 PASS / 0 findings, 0 reboots, 0 asserts, heap flat**;
  `ssh_handshake_flood` also dropped from ~237 s (crash-stalled) to ~19 s. The pentest reboot detector was
  fixed in the same pass (an ESP32 reboot times out rather than `ECONNREFUSED`), so a crash-and-recover is no
  longer mis-read as "alive".
- **Note:** a speculative `PC_OP_CLOSE` teardown-reorder tried earlier changed the reboot count by nothing
  and was reverted rather than shipped - the real bug was the missing NULL test, not the CLOSE path.

## SSH server host-key name-list truncated - `rsa-sha2-256` dropped when all three host keys are loaded

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-20). Found by a **real-OpenSSH interop matrix on an ESP32-P4** (the shipped
  SSH server, all four host-key algorithms forced one at a time via `ssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=`).
- **Symptom:** with ed25519 **and** ecdsa-p256 **and** RSA host keys all provisioned, a client that forced
  `rsa-sha2-256` got `Unable to negotiate ... no matching host key type`. The server's advertised
  `server_host_key_algorithms` list came across truncated: `ssh-ed25519,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,rsa-sha2-512,rs`
    - the last entry `rsa-sha2-256` cut to `rs`. `rsa-sha2-512` (one earlier) still worked, which is what made
      it look key-specific rather than a buffer overrun.
- **Root cause:** `ssh_kexinit_build()` assembled the host-key name-list into a **48-byte** stack buffer
  (`ssh_transport.c` `char hklist[48]`). The full four-algorithm list
  `ssh-ed25519,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256` is **57 chars + NUL = 58 bytes**, so the
  bounded `snprintf` in `build_hostkey_list()` stopped after `...rsa-sha2-512,rs`. It only bites when all
  three key types are held at once - the SSH example loads just RSA and the pentest rig just ed25519, so the
  list was always short enough before; a device provisioned with all three (a realistic deployment) hit it.
- **Fix:** size the buffer to hold the full list - `hklist[64]`. Regression test
  `test_kexinit_hostkey_list_carries_all_four_when_all_keys_loaded` (native_ssh_transport) provisions all
  three host keys and asserts every algorithm, incl. `rsa-sha2-256`, survives in the built KEXINIT; it fails
  on the old 48-byte buffer and passes on 64. Confirmed on HW: the P4 interop matrix went 15/16 -> **16/16**
  after the fix (every KEX incl. the mlkem768x25519 hybrid, every cipher/MAC, all four host-key algorithms).

## A board profile's hardcoded `RX_BUF_SIZE` silently defeated the streaming ring floor (large uploads reset)

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-20). Found while auditing the per-variant board-profile defaults; the failure
  mode and the fix were both confirmed on an ESP32-S3 rig (COM7), which corrected an initial mis-diagnosis.
- **Symptom:** on any chip whose profile pins `RX_BUF_SIZE` below the streaming floor (S3/P4/S31 = 2048,
  C3/C5/C6/H4 = 1536, the rest = 1024), enabling `PC_ENABLE_UPLOAD`/`OTA`/`WEBDAV` (streaming) left that small
  ring in place instead of raising it to 8192. **HW-measured on an S3 pinned at 2048:** a 4 KB upload succeeds
  byte-exact, but a 64 KB streamed upload is **reset ~5.6 s in** (`curl` exit 56, 0 bytes stored). With the ring
  at 8192, the same 64 KB (0.7 s) and a 256 KB (1.6 s, ~160 KB/s) upload round-trip **byte-exact**.
- **Root cause (two parts):** (1) the feature-driven ring upsize lived inline in `protocore_config.h` gated on
  `defined(PC_RX_BUF_SIZE_DEFAULTED)` - a marker set **only** in the base `#ifndef RX_BUF_SIZE` branch. A board
  profile is included first and sets `RX_BUF_SIZE` itself, so that branch (and the marker) is skipped and the
  upsize is a silent no-op for every profile that pins the ring. (2) The failure is _not_ a deadlock (the initial
  guess): with ack-on-consume the peer's advertised window tracks ring free space, so a sub-window ring forces a
  sustained upload to dribble a ring-full at a time and spend long spells in backpressure. The idle timer is
  refreshed only when a segment is **accepted**, never during backpressure (deliberate - a truly stuck connection
  must still be reaped, [[tcp.cpp]] `:850`), so a prolonged sub-window backpressure spell trips the 5 s idle
  timeout and the connection is reset mid-upload.
- **Fix:** move the resolution out of `protocore_config.h` into `core_setup/board_profiles/derived_sizing.h` (the sizing layer's
  job), included last once every feature flag is known, and drop the `DEFAULTED` gate so the floor is enforced
  against whatever set the value - profile, `-D`, or base default - as a monotone raise (below floor -> lift;
  at/above -> untouched, so a deliberately roomy ring is preserved). Because the streaming floor is a full TCP
  window (8192), it is real DRAM per connection: the classic-ESP32 streaming examples (FileUpload / OTA /
  OtaRollback / WebDav) dial `MAX_CONNS` down so `8192 * MAX_CONNS` fits the ~122 KB `dram0_0_seg`.

## Reverse-SSH tunnel: scratch foreign-task crash + channel-slot starvation

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-20). Found by the **HW bring-up of the reverse-SSH client** on an ESP32-S3 tunnelling
  to a real OpenSSH 10.0 relay and serving the device's own `:80` back through it - the whole-firmware,
  two-task path host tests cannot reach.
- **Symptom (1):** the SSH handshake, ed25519 auth and `tcpip-forward` all succeeded ("tunnel up"), but the first
  `curl` through the forwarded port panicked the device with `assert_single_owner scratch.cpp:78 "scratch arena
borrowed from a foreign task"`. **Symptom (2):** after that was fixed, the first request returned HTTP 200 but
  every subsequent one hung / returned 000 until the channel eventually freed.
- **Root cause (1):** SSH packet decrypt borrows the shared per-worker scratch arena, which is single-accessor-
  per-task. The PC server's worker owns slot 0; the tunnel `poll()` runs in a different task, so opening the
  forwarded-tcpip channel decrypted a packet from a foreign task and tripped the tripwire. **Root cause (2):** the
  client held a single channel slot and only freed it on the relay's `CHANNEL_CLOSE`, which OpenSSH sends late -
  it waits for the device's EOF, which never came because the bridged keep-alive `:80` connection never closes.
  So the slot stayed busy and later `forwarded-tcpip` opens were refused ("administratively prohibited").
- **Fix:** (1) give the reverse-SSH client its own scratch slot - `PC_SCRATCH_SLOTS = PC_WORKER_COUNT + 1` when
  `PC_ENABLE_SSH_CLIENT`, claimed in `begin()` via `pc_worker_set_self()` so every later decrypt in that task
  uses the client's own arena. (2) replace the single channel with a pool (`PC_SSH_CLIENT_MAX_CHANNELS`, with
  `PC_CLIENT_CONNS` auto-provisioned to `1 + N`), and tear a channel down promptly on the relay's **EOF** (the
  forwarded peer is done sending; for a request/response bridge the reply is already delivered) instead of waiting
  for its CLOSE. Re-flashed: single, 6 rapid-sequential and 4 concurrent requests all return HTTP 200 with the
  device's body byte-for-byte, sustained across repeated bursts; `native_ssh` + `native_ssh_conn` + `native_pqc`
  (220 cases) stay green.

## SSH transport dropped a TCP read that carried several pipelined packets (SFTP write)

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-17). Found by the **HW bring-up of the SFTP server** on an ESP32-S3 + SD card,
  driven by the real OpenSSH `sftp` client - the exact whole-firmware path host tests cannot reach.
- **Symptom:** a small (< 2 KB) `put` round-tripped byte-exact, but any larger `put` reset the connection during
  the first `SSH2_FXP_WRITE` (client saw "broken pipe"); the device did not crash (heap stable, no panic).
- **Root cause (two layers):** (1) the `CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION` advertised `SSH_CHAN_MAX_PACKET` = 32768 as
  the max packet we can receive, but the transport rejects any inbound packet larger than `SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE`
  (2048) - so a peer that believed the advertisement (an SFTP write) sent a packet the transport threw away.
  (2) more fundamentally, `ssh_pkt_recv()` appended the whole incoming read to its `SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE` buffer
  _before_ extracting packets and disconnected if the read exceeded the remaining space - so a single TCP read
  carrying several back-to-back CHANNEL_DATA messages (which is exactly how a client pipelines a large SFTP
  write's fragments) overflowed the buffer even though every individual packet fit. Interactive shells never
  send enough at once to hit either.
- **Fix:** (1) derive `SSH_CHAN_MAX_PACKET` from `SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE` (`- 64`) so we never advertise more than we
  can receive, and it scales when the buffer is raised for throughput. (2) `ssh_pkt_recv()` now consumes its
  input **incrementally** - append as much as fits, extract every complete packet to drain the buffer, then
  append more - so a multi-packet read is processed instead of rejected. Re-flashed: a 60 KB `put`/`get`
  round-trips byte-exact over the SD card, and `native_ssh` + `native_ssh_conn` (209 cases) stay green.

## SFTP READDIR NAME response carried a garbage 4-byte prefix per entry

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-17). Found by the same SFTP HW bring-up: `put`/`get` worked byte-exact but any
  `ls` on a non-empty directory reset the connection.
- **Root cause:** `build_entry()` serialized a directory entry with an `SftpWriter`, which reserves a 4-byte
  packet-length prefix, and returned the entry length - but the entry _data_ started at `ent + 4`, while
  `do_readdir()` copied from `ent[0]`. So every NAME entry was prefixed with 4 bytes of the discarded length
  field, malforming the response; the client rejected it and disconnected.
- **Fix:** `build_entry()` drops the reserved prefix (`memmove(ent, ent + 4, len)`) so the entry bytes start at
  `ent[0]`. Re-flashed: `ls -l` lists files with correct sizes / longnames, and rename / rm take effect.

## Edge-cache mesh serving node RST'd the response before it drained (immediate close)

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-17). Found by the **two-rig HW bring-up** of the new mesh sibling cache
  (`PC_ENABLE_EDGE_MESH`) on two ESP32-S3s - the exact whole-firmware path host mock-seam tests cannot
  reach (the mock transport does not model TCP flush/close).
- **Symptom:** node B's cold miss for an object node A had cached always fell through to the origin
  (`X-Cache: MISS`, `mesh_misses` incremented, the origin logged a hit from B) instead of pulling from A
  (`X-Cache: MESH`). A hand-crafted valid mesh request to A over `:7645` got the connection **reset with 0
  bytes** (`WinError 10054`) - so A built a response but it never reached the peer.
- **Root cause:** the `PROTO_MESH` serve pump queued the whole response with `pc_conn_send` (which
  `tcp_write`s with `TCP_WRITE_FLAG_COPY`) and then immediately called `pc_conn_close` - the **immediate**
  teardown, which `tcp_close`s and, if the FIN cannot queue, `tcp_abort`s (RST), discarding the just-queued
  response the peer had not read yet. The requester then saw a closed connection with no complete frame →
  `MESH_FAIL` → treated as a miss → origin fallthrough.
- **Fix:** after queuing the full response, `pc_conn_flush(slot)` (tcp_output) then `pc_conn_begin_close(slot)`
    - the graceful dwell that holds the slot in `CONN_CLOSING` until the peer ACKs, finalizing from the sent
      callback once the TX drains (the same sequence `websocket_sse` uses for its response-then-close). The
      `closing_finalize` path does not dispatch the proto `on_close`, and `pc_conn_send` already COPY'd the
      bytes, so the `MeshConn` is freed proactively right after `begin_close`. Re-flashed both rigs: B's cold miss
      now serves `X-Cache: MESH` byte-exact from A with `Age` propagated, the origin is fetched exactly once (by
      A), and fall-through / symmetry / loop-free all pass. Classic HW-only integration bug (green host tests, a
      real RST on the wire).

---

## Edge-cache Range on a MISS lost the client's Range header (stale http_pool[slot])

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-17). Found by the **HW MISS+Range test** of the new Range/206-from-cache
  feature on an ESP32-S3 - the exact integration path host tests cannot reach.
- **Symptom:** a `Range: bytes=15-35` request against a **cold** cache returned the **full 200** body
  (83 bytes, `HTTP/1.0`, `X-Cache: MISS`) instead of a `206` window. A fresh-**HIT** Range request worked
  (byte-exact `206`), so range parsing/serving was correct - only the miss path lost the range.
- **Root cause:** `serve_hit` read the `Range` header from `http_pool[slot]`. On a fresh hit that runs
  synchronously in dispatch while `http_pool[slot]` is still the client request. But a miss/stale entry is
  served from the **poll loop after the async origin fetch**, by which point `http_pool[slot]` has been
  reset/reused (the tell: the miss response was `HTTP/1.0` - `send_chunked`'s version fallback fires because
  `http_pool[slot].version` is no longer `HTTP_11`), so `Range` (and the version) were gone.
- **Fix:** capture the client `Range` header at **middleware time** (when `http_pool[slot]` is valid) into a
  per-slot owned buffer `EdgeCacheProxyCtx::range_hdr[MAX_CONNS][48]`, and resolve the window against that in
  `serve_hit`. Re-flashed: a cold-MISS `Range: bytes=15-35` now returns `206` + `Content-Range: bytes
15-35/83` + the byte-exact 21-byte window, and HIT/416/HEAD/`Accept-Ranges` all stay byte-exact.
- **Related (pre-existing, not fixed here):** the same `http_pool[slot]`-goes-stale-after-the-async-fetch
  root cause means a miss response is emitted as `HTTP/1.0` (`Connection: close` instead of keep-alive), and
  `store_response`'s `Vary`-value capture reads the stale request - so a `Vary` response cached on a miss
  stores an empty/garbage secondary key (it degrades to always-miss-and-refetch for that variant; never
  serves wrong content). Both are latent efficiency issues present since the RAM tier and want a holistic
  fix (preserve or snapshot the client request across the suspend); tracked in TODO.md.

## EdgeCache example opened no HTTP listener - server.begin() with no port

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-17). Found by the **first HW bring-up** of the edge cache on an ESP32-S3: the
  board joined WiFi and its TCP stack was alive (it RST'd port 80), but nothing served - `:80` was refused.
- **Symptom:** `GET /cdn/<path>` got a connection refusal; the board pinged fine and actively refused `:80`.
  A serial DIAG confirmed the edge cache itself was configured (`map=1`, `begin=1` listeners) but no HTTP
  port was open.
- **Root cause:** the example called `server.begin()` with no port and no prior `server.listen()`. `begin()`
  with no argument requires a registered listener (else it returns `PC_ERR_NO_LISTENERS` and starts
  nothing); the single-HTTP-port form is `server.begin(80)`. A library-contract slip in the example, not a
  library defect.
- **Fix:** `server.begin(80)` in `examples/L7-Application/EdgeCache`. Re-flashed; the full
  MISS -> HIT -> REVALIDATED(304) -> purge path then passed byte-exact against a real origin. Exactly the
  class of whole-firmware integration bug that host mock-seam tests miss and a real HW run catches.

---

## native_codeql (all-flags) test_dispatch 405/Allow tests fail - CSRF gate, hidden by CI

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-17). Found 2026-07-16 by the WSL native env actually _running_ the
  `native_codeql` suite. **CI never caught it** because the CodeQL workflow builds `native_codeql` with
  `pio test --without-testing` (compile-only, to trace the build) - its assertions have never executed in CI.
- **Symptom:** under the all-feature-flags `native_codeql` config, `test_get_route_advertises_head_in_allow`
  (POST to a GET-only route → expect `405` + `GET`/`HEAD` in Allow) and `test_405_includes_allow_header`
  (DELETE to a POST-only route → expect `Allow: POST`) both failed (`Expected Non-NULL`), while the same tests
  driven with **GET** (`test_method_mismatch_returns_405`, `test_405_allow_lists_all_methods_for_path`) and
  `HEAD` passed.
- **Root cause:** a **feature-flag interaction, not a dispatch bug** - the all-flags build enables
  `PC_ENABLE_CSRF`, and `csrf_gate` (protocore.cpp) runs _before_ the route loop and rejects any un-tokened
  state-changing method (`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) with `403`, so those requests never reach the
  §6.5.5 405/Allow dispatch. `GET`/`HEAD`/`OPTIONS` are CSRF-exempt, so they still 405. This is the intended,
  fail-closed security behavior (don't leak a path's allowed methods to an un-tokened request); the **test**
  simply didn't account for CSRF being on.
- **Fix:** the two unsafe-method tests now attach a valid `X-CSRF-Token` (via `feed_unsafe` + a suite-level
  `csrf_set_secret` in `setUp`, both `#if PC_ENABLE_CSRF`), so a legitimate token-bearing request reaches
  the 405/Allow dispatch; with CSRF off the request line is plain. Verified: `native_codeql:test_dispatch`
  11/11 (was 2 failed) and `native_app:test_dispatch` (CSRF off) still green.

## DTLS 1.3 HelloRetryRequest carried the TLS version codepoints (0x0303 / 0x0304) instead of DTLS (0xFEFD / 0xFEFC)

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-15). Found by **real-peer interop** the moment the HelloRetryRequest path was first
  driven end-to-end (wolfSSL DTLS 1.3 client leading with a non-X25519 group; `test/servers/dtls_wolfssl`). The
  HRR builder shipped in v6.17.0 but was never wired into the state machine until the HRR group renegotiation
  landed, so no released version ever sent an HRR - the bug was latent in unexercised code.
- **Symptom:** with the client offering only a non-X25519 key_share, the server correctly answered with a
  HelloRetryRequest, but wolfSSL rejected it with a protocol_version alert (`-326`, record layer version error).
  The direct one-round-trip path (client offers X25519 up front) worked, because its first server message is a
  ServerHello - which _did_ use the DTLS codepoints - while the HRR did not.
- **Root cause:** `tls13_build_server_hello` already took a `dtls` flag to emit `legacy_version` `0xFEFD` and
  `supported_versions` `0xFEFC` (RFC 9147 §5.3), but `tls13_build_hello_retry_request` - a separate builder for
  the same ServerHello structure - hard-coded `0x0303` / `0x0304`. The byte-exact HRR KAT (`native_dtls_tls13`)
  had pinned those TLS codepoints, so it stayed green: another self-referential KAT that shared the mistake.
- **Fix:** `tls13_build_hello_retry_request` gained the same `dtls` flag (`0xFEFD` / `0xFEFC` when set); the
  DTLS state machine passes `dtls=true`, and the HRR KAT was recomputed with the DTLS codepoints. Verified
  end-to-end: wolfSSL now completes the full handshake **through a HelloRetryRequest** and an application-data
  round trip (`HANDSHAKE OK (via HelloRetryRequest)` ... `INTEROP OK`).
- **Lesson:** exactly [the same lesson as the entry below](#dtls-13-used-the-tls-13-tls13--hkdf-label-prefix-instead-of-dtls13-plus-two-dtls-clienthelloversion-bugs) -
  a self-KAT proves self-consistency, not conformance. The moment a new code path (the HRR) was exercised
  against a real peer, it surfaced a deviation the green KAT had frozen in. Wire up real-peer interop for
  _every_ path, not just the happy one.

---

## DTLS 1.3 used the TLS 1.3 "tls13 " HKDF label prefix instead of "dtls13" (plus two DTLS ClientHello/version bugs)

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-15). Three DTLS-vs-TLS conformance bugs found by the first **real-peer interop**
  (wolfSSL DTLS 1.3 client vs. `dtls_conn`; `test/servers/dtls_wolfssl`). Shipped in v6.15.0 (record layer)
  and v6.18.0 (handshake).
- **Symptom:** the hand-rolled DTLS 1.3 server completed a self-consistent handshake against its own test
  client but could not interoperate with wolfSSL at all - the ClientHello failed to parse, then (after that
  was fixed) the handshake was rejected on version, then (after that) the AEAD open of the peer's first
  encrypted record failed because the derived keys diverged.
- **Root causes (all DTLS-specific deviations from TLS 1.3 that the self-referential host KATs could not
  catch, since the KATs shared the implementation's assumptions):**
    1. **`legacy_cookie`** (RFC 9147 §5.3): the DTLS ClientHello carries an extra `legacy_cookie` field between
       `legacy_session_id` and `cipher_suites`; the shared `tls13_parse_client_hello` (written for QUIC) skipped
       it, so it read `cipher_suites` at the wrong offset and the parse failed.
    2. **Version codepoints** (RFC 9147 §5.3): DTLS 1.3 advertises `0xFEFC` in `supported_versions` (not the TLS
       `0x0304`) and puts `legacy_version` `0xFEFD` in the ServerHello. The server checked for `0x0304` and sent
       a TLS ServerHello, so wolfSSL rejected it with a protocol_version alert.
    3. **HKDF-Expand-Label prefix** (RFC 9147 §5.9): DTLS 1.3 replaces the `"tls13 "` label prefix with
       `"dtls13"` in **every** Expand-Label - both the key schedule (traffic secrets, Finished) and the record
       `key`/`iv`/`sn`. The DTLS code reused `quic_hkdf_expand_label`, which hard-coded `"tls13 "`, so every
       DTLS secret was wrong. Diagnosed by dumping our handshake-traffic secret and comparing to wolfSSL's
       `SSLKEYLOGFILE`, then bisecting transcript vs. key-schedule in an independent Python reconstruction.
- **Fix:** (1) `tls13_parse_client_hello` takes a `dtls` flag that skips `legacy_cookie`; (2)
  `tls13_build_server_hello` + `supported_versions` parse use the DTLS codepoints under the same flag; (3) the
  label prefix became a first-class KDF variant - `Tls13Kdf` (`TLS13_KDF` / `DTLS13_KDF`), bound once into the
  `Tls13KeySchedule` and passed to the record-key derivation, replacing the hard-coded prefix (no `bool dtls`
  threaded through the schedule). The record KAT was recomputed with `"dtls13"`. Verified end-to-end: wolfSSL
  now completes the handshake **and** an application-data round trip (`INTEROP OK`).
- **Lesson:** a byte-exact KAT pinned to your _own_ independent reimplementation proves self-consistency, not
  conformance - it shares your misreadings of the spec. A real reference peer (or vectors from one) is the
  only thing that catches a wrong-but-consistent assumption. Every new wire protocol needs a real-peer interop
  check, not just a self-KAT.

## SSH server KEXINIT (I_S) overflowed its 512-byte store once ecdh-sha2-nistp256 was advertised

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-15). Found while adding the `ecdh-sha2-nistp256` KEX (v6.14.0).
- **Symptom:** advertising one more KEX algorithm made `ssh_kexinit_build()` return `-1` in some builds; two
  native tests (`test_begin_rekey_preserves_session_and_auth`, `test_ssh_transport_more_guards`) failed with
  a stack-smash abort (SIGQUIT) once the payload crossed the buffer edge.
- **Root cause:** `SSH_KEXINIT_S_MAX` was `512`, exactly enough for the _previous_ advertised suite. Adding
  `ecdh-sha2-nistp256,` (19 bytes) to `kex_algorithms` pushed the worst-case server KEXINIT (PQC hybrid + zlib
  s2c + all three host-key types + the full cipher/MAC lists ~= 580 bytes) past 512, tripping the `w.len >
SSH_KEXINIT_S_MAX` guard (which had been marked "never exceeds"). The production packet buffer
  (`SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE = 2048`) was fine; the fixed `i_s[]` store and one test's local 512-byte buffer were not.
- **Fix:** raised `SSH_KEXINIT_S_MAX` to `704` (headroom over the ~580 worst case) and grew the test's local
  `kbuf` to 1024. Also corrected `test_kexinit_parse_rejects_missing_kex`, which had used `ecdh-sha2-nistp256`
  as its example of an _unsupported_ KEX - now `ecdh-sha2-nistp521`.
- **Lesson:** a buffer sized to _exactly_ fit today's advertised algorithm lists breaks the next time a list
  grows. Size protocol-list buffers to the theoretical worst case with headroom, and never mark a length guard
  "unreachable" - it is one algorithm away from firing.

---

## InterfaceBridge: ESP32 Build linked without its feature flag - pc_bridge_publish undefined

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-15, commit 90e5a972).
- **Symptom:** the **ESP32 Build** CI job for `InterfaceBridge` failed at link with an undefined reference to
  `pc_bridge_publish()` - chronically red since the example shipped (v6.8.0).
- **Root cause:** the ESP32 Build discovers each example's `build_flags` by scraping the first documented
  `pio ci` command from its `README.md` (`tools/ci_tooling/generate/example_footprints.py`). InterfaceBridge's README had no
  such command, so CI built it with _empty_ flags: the library's `iface_bridge_hw.cpp` guards its body under
  `#if PC_ENABLE_IFACE_BRIDGE`, so with the flag absent `pc_bridge_publish()` compiled to nothing while the
  sketch (which sets the flag only in its own translation unit) still referenced it. An in-sketch `#define`
  never reaches the separately compiled library.
- **Fix:** added the standard `## Build` section with `-DPC_ENABLE_IFACE_BRIDGE=1` to the README, matching
  every other feature-gated example. Verified `pio ci` links on a real ESP32 (esp32dev, 59.5% flash) and the
  ESP32 Build CI turned green.
- **Lesson:** when the build system derives config from docs, a missing doc line is a silent build break. Every
  feature-gated example needs its `pio ci` build-flag command in the README, not just an in-sketch `#define`.

---

## Protocol dispatch: PROTO_BRIDGE (and any ProtoConn id >= 8) silently never registered

- **Status:** FIXED (2026-07-14). Found while adding `PROTO_NTRIP_CASTER = 9`.
- **Symptom:** the interface-bridge listener (`PROTO_BRIDGE = 8`, shipped v6.8.0) would accept connections but
  its handler was never invoked - the dispatch table returned no handler for the slot - so a bridged port did
  nothing. Latent because the v6.8.0 verification was a host codec test + a compile, not a live PROTO_BRIDGE
  connection.
- **Root cause:** `PC_PROTO_MAX` (the dispatch-table size) was `8`, and both `proto_register()` and
  `proto_get()` bound-check with `(unsigned)proto < PC_PROTO_MAX`. `PROTO_BRIDGE = 8` fails `8 < 8`, so the
  handler was neither stored nor fetched. Adding a ProtoConn id at/above the table size silently disabled it.
- **Fix:** raised `PC_PROTO_MAX` to `10` and added a `static_assert((unsigned)ProtoConn::PROTO_NTRIP_CASTER
< PC_PROTO_MAX, ...)` next to the enum's config so any future proto that outgrows the table is a compile
  error, not a silent no-op.
- **Lesson:** a fixed-size table indexed by an enum needs a static_assert pinning the size to the enum's max; an
  off-by-the-newest-value ceiling is invisible without one, and "compiles + host test passes" does not exercise
  runtime registration. Verify a new listener with a live connection, not only a compile.

## W5500: large transfers crash / truncate - marginal SPI signal integrity, NOT a library defect

- **Status:** NOT A LIBRARY BUG (hardware; 2026-07-13). Root-caused by JTAG + an SPI-clock sweep, resolved by
  clean wiring + a conservative clock. Logged so it is not re-chased as a software bug.
- **Symptom:** on an ESP32-S3 + W5500 (breadboard jumpers), a large streamed download (`send_chunked`) crashed
  the board mid-transfer; curl saw a connection reset (`rc=56`). Small requests succeeded.
- **Investigation:** a JTAG break-in under load caught a **TLSF heap-corruption panic**
  (`assert block_is_free ... "block must be free"`) inside `emac_w5500_task -> esp_pbuf_allocate -> mem_malloc`
    - the W5500 driver's RX path, entirely upstream, with **zero library frames**. The corrupt tlsf was in PSRAM.
      Initial hypotheses (our send path flooding lwIP; pbufs spilling to a PSRAM heap) were **disproved** by
      instrumenting the live heap: across clean 50 MB and 200 MB transfers the internal heap never drained, **PSRAM
      was never allocated from** (`psram_free` flat), and `heap_caps_check_integrity_all` stayed OK. Our
      `chunk_send_pump` already honors `tcp_sndbuf` backpressure and is zero-heap.
- **Root cause:** marginal **SPI signal integrity**. After the W5500 was rewired in isolation (off shared
  breadboard rails / USB3 noise), the same firmware streamed **200 MB byte-exact** with a flat heap. An SPI-clock
  sweep then reproduced the failure **on demand**: clean to ~24 MHz sustained, truncation at 40-60 MHz, and at
  80 MHz the W5500 chip-ID read back `0x82` instead of `0x04` - a corrupted SPI read. A corrupted frame length
  from a bad SPI read makes the driver over-copy into a pbuf, which is what corrupts the heap. So the "crash" was
  a downstream symptom of bad wiring, not a code defect.
- **Fix / mitigation:** added `PC_ETH_W5500_SPI_MHZ` (default 20, the safe/upstream value proven at 200 MB) so
  the clock can be tuned to the wiring; documented the SPI-bound throughput curve and the signal-integrity ceiling
  in FEATURE_PERFORMANCE.md / HARDWARE_HOOKUP.md. No library code was at fault.
- **Lesson:** an upstream-only backtrace plus a **flat heap under load** points at hardware, not the library; the
  cheapest confirmation was an SPI-clock sweep that turned an intermittent crash into a monotonic, explainable
  signal-integrity curve. Overclocking a bus to force the failure beats guessing at a software cause.

## Transport: a large streamed response (chunked / file) truncates mid-transfer - the idle sweep reaps an actively-sending connection

- **Status:** FIXED (library, 2026-07-13; found by a 1 GB download benchmark against ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer
  on an ESP32-S3, then reproduced deterministically).
- **Symptom:** a response whose body is much larger than one TCP window (`send_chunked` or `serve_file`) drops
  mid-stream at a **non-deterministic** point - observed once at 233 MB with a connection reset (curl `rc=56`) and
  once at 86 MB with a short clean close - while small requests to the same server keep succeeding. The same 1 GB
  download served by ESPAsyncWebServer completes fine.
- **Root cause:** the `CONN_TIMEOUT_MS` (5 s) idle sweep in `check_timeouts()` reaps any `CONN_ACTIVE` slot whose
  `last_activity_ms` is older than 5 s. That timestamp is refreshed on RX (recv callback) and on TX **ACK** (sent
  callback), so a healthy stream stays fresh - until a **transient send stall** (a Wi-Fi hiccup, or a brief full
  window with no ACKs) exceeds 5 s, at which point the sweep reaps a connection that is **actively mid-transfer**,
  truncating the body. (Same 5 s mechanism as the SSH "drops every framed packet after the banner" bug below, a
  different trigger.)
- **Fix:** a slot still paging out a body is active, not idle. The file/chunk send pumps now call
  `pc_conn_touch_active(slot)` each poll they run (they run every `handle()` loop through the `on_poll` seam),
  refreshing the idle timer so the sweep cannot reap an in-flight transfer. Dead-peer teardown for such a slot is
  delegated to lwIP's own retransmission timers, which abort a black-holed pcb through the err callback. The
  timestamp read that a size-based check would need lives on `tcpip_thread`, so refreshing from the worker-side
  pump (writing our own `last_activity_ms`) is the layer-clean signal.
- **Validation:** native `native` (334, incl. `test_transport`) + `native_keepalive` (11) + `native_range` (20)
  all pass. HW (ESP32-S3): a deterministic reproduction - pause the client 9 s (> 5 s) mid-stream with `SIGSTOP`
  so ACKs starve - truncates on the pre-fix build and **survives on the fixed build** (the transfer resumes on
  `SIGCONT` and keeps streaming). Regression test `test_active_send_not_reaped`.
- **Lesson:** an idle-timeout sweep must exclude a connection with an in-flight response - "no activity for N
  seconds" only means "idle" when nothing is being sent. A large-transfer **stress** test (not a happy-path smoke)
  is what exposes it; a small-response test never streams long enough to hit a stall.

## SSH: SERVICE_REQUEST accepted before key exchange completes - pre-encryption userauth bypass

- **Status:** FIXED (library, 2026-07-11; found by the pentest tool's `ssh_msgtype_abuse` against the S3 rig).
- **Symptom:** a client that sends its KEXINIT and then - instead of completing the key exchange - sends
  `SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST("ssh-userauth")` gets `SSH_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT` back and the server advances to the
  userauth phase, all in **cleartext** (no NEWKEYS, no session keys derived, no host-key verification).
- **Root cause:** the `SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST` case in `ssh_server_dispatch()` had **no phase guard** (unlike
  `KEXDH_INIT` and `USERAUTH_REQUEST`, which check their phase). It processed a service request in any phase,
  so a client could jump `SSH_PHASE_DH_INIT` -> `SSH_PHASE_AUTH`, skipping the entire key exchange. RFC 4253
  §10 requires the service request only after the key exchange (`ssh_newkeys_complete()` advances a fresh
  connection to `SSH_PHASE_SERVICE` and turns on encryption).
- **Fix:** guard the case with `if (s->phase != SSH_PHASE_SERVICE) return -1;`, so a premature service request
  is rejected and the connection closed. Regression test `test_service_request_before_newkeys_rejected`.
  HW-verified: the pentest `ssh_msgtype_abuse` attack goes from 1 finding to 0, and a real OpenSSH login
  (which sends SERVICE_REQUEST in the correct phase, after NEWKEYS) still completes 6/6.
- **Lesson:** every state-machine transition that grants a capability needs an explicit phase guard; the
  raw-socket adversarial client that ignores the normal message order is the thing that finds the gap - a
  well-behaved client (or a host test that drives the happy-path sequence) never would.

## SSH: server drops every framed packet after the banner - the dispatcher's emit callback is never wired

- **Status:** FIXED (library, 2026-07-11; root-caused + fixed with a real OpenSSH 10.0 client, tcpdump, and
  on-device counters over JTAG on an ESP32-S3).
- **Symptom:** a real SSH client connects, both sides exchange identification banners, the client sends its
  KEXINIT - then the connection is `reset by peer` ~5 s later and the server's KEXINIT never arrives (`ssh -v`).
  tcpdump: the device **ACKs** the 672-byte client KEXINIT (lwIP received it), then sends nothing for exactly
  5 s (`CONN_TIMEOUT_MS`) before the RST. No panic, no reboot - the device is healthy, it just never replies.
- **Root cause:** `ssh_conn_setup()` - which installs the SSH dispatcher's binary-packet emit callback via
  `ssh_server_set_emit_cb(ssh_emit)` - had **no production caller**. It was declared, defined, and documented
  ("call from begin()"), but nothing ever called it, so `s_srv.emit_cb` stayed null. The server-identification
  banner is written directly by `ssh_conn_accept()` (not through the callback), so it still went out; but every
  _framed_ SSH packet - KEXINIT, KEXDH_REPLY, NEWKEYS, channel data - is emitted through the null callback and
  silently dropped, so the handshake stalls forever and the client is reset on the idle timeout. On-device
  counters confirmed the receive path was perfect (`rx_enter=2 bytes=713 disp=1 msg=20`, KEXINIT parsed + reply
  built `n=422`) while `SSHEMIT enter=0`: `ssh_emit` was never reached because the callback was null.
- **Why host tests missed it:** every SSH test wires the emit callback itself (`ssh_server_set_emit_cb(rec_emit)`
  in test_ssh_server; `ssh_conn_setup()` in test_ssh_conn's `setUp`) and then drives `ssh_server_dispatch` /
  `ssh_conn_rx` directly. The mechanism was covered; the **production wiring** was not - a mock-seam blind spot.
- **Fix:** `ssh_proto_handler()` (the one accessor every consumer goes through to install SSH) now calls
  `ssh_conn_setup()` before returning, so registering the handler always wires the emit callback - it can never
  be forgotten again. Regression guard `test_proto_handler_wires_emit` clears the callback, calls
  `ssh_proto_handler()`, drives a banner+KEXINIT, and asserts the server's reply reaches the socket (fails
  without the fix; verified). HW-verified end to end on an ESP32-S3 vs OpenSSH 10.0: curve25519-sha256 KEX,
  ssh-ed25519 host key, NEWKEYS, `Authenticated ... using "password"`, and a byte-exact channel echo over
  chacha20-poly1305.
- **Lesson:** a unit test that installs the production callback itself proves the mechanism but not that the
  mechanism is wired in production. Wire such one-time hookups at the single install seam (the handler
  accessor), not as a separate step a caller must remember.

---

## Native build: transport unit envs fail to compile - freertos/task.h has no host mock

- **Status:** FIXED (test infra, 2026-07-11).
- **Symptom:** `pio test -e native_ssh_conn` (and every native env that compiles `tcp.cpp`) fails at the build
  stage: `src/network_drivers/transport/tcp.c:31:10: fatal error: freertos/task.h: No such file or directory`.
- **Root cause:** the TLS tcpip-thread self-detection fix (babf01f4) added `#include "freertos/task.h"` (for
  `xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle()`) to `tcp.cpp` unconditionally, but the host build resolves `freertos/*` through
  `test/mocks/freertos/` and only `FreeRTOS.h` + `queue.h` were mocked - `task.h` was missing. Its symbols are
  used only inside `#if defined(ARDUINO)` code, so on the host the include just needs to resolve.
- **Fix:** added `test/mocks/freertos/task.h` (typedef `TaskHandle_t` + an `xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle()` stub),
  matching the existing host-mock pattern. All native transport/session/SSH envs build again.

## HTTP/3: QUIC frame parser rejects standard post-handshake frames - real clients get FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR

- **Status:** FIXED (library, 2026-07-11; found + fixed same day with an aioquic client on the PSRAM board).
- **Symptom:** `QUIC handshake: CONNECTED`, then the device sends CONNECTION_CLOSE `error_code=0x07`
  (FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR) and the h3 `GET /` times out. aioquic's event log:
  `ConnectionTerminated(error_code=7, frame_type=0)`.
- **Root cause:** `quic_frame_parse()` (`quic_frame.cpp`) only decodes PADDING, PING, HANDSHAKE_DONE, ACK,
  ACK_ECN, CRYPTO, STREAM (0x08-0x0f), MAX_DATA, and CONNECTION_CLOSE; for **every other frame type it
  returns 0** (line ~122, "a frame type this minimal server does not handle"), and `process_frames()`
  turns a 0 into FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR + closes the connection (quic_conn.cpp:193). But a real QUIC client
  sends connection-management + flow-control frames right after the handshake - **MAX_STREAMS (0x12/0x13),
  MAX_STREAM_DATA (0x11), NEW_CONNECTION_ID (0x18), NEW_TOKEN (0x07), DATA_BLOCKED (0x14),
  STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED (0x15), STREAMS_BLOCKED (0x16/0x17), RESET_STREAM (0x04), STOP_SENDING (0x05),
  RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID (0x19), PATH_CHALLENGE/PATH_RESPONSE (0x1a/0x1b)** - so the very first 1-RTT packet
  carrying the h3 request also carries one of these and the whole packet is rejected. RFC 9000 requires an
  endpoint to be able to parse every defined frame type (it may ignore the ones it does not act on);
  returning FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR for a well-formed known frame is both a spec violation and an interop
  break with any real client.
- **Fix:** `quic_frame_parse()` (+ named constants in `quic_frame.h`) now **consumes** (skips) all the
  standard frame types above with their correct varint/byte layout, so they parse successfully and the
  dispatcher ignores the ones with no server-side action (like it already does for MAX_DATA/PING). Grouped
  by wire shape (1/2/3 varints; length-prefixed NEW_TOKEN/NEW_CONNECTION_ID; fixed-width
  PATH_CHALLENGE/RESPONSE). HW-verified with aioquic: `h3 GET / -> :status=200` (HeadersReceived +
  DataReceived, body served over QUIC). HTTP/3 device-as-server now works end to end.
- **Lesson:** "a minimal server only parses what it acts on" is wrong for QUIC - the transport must parse
  the whole frame grammar even to ignore it, or the first real-client packet closes the connection.

## HTTP/3: QUIC handshake crashes the device - worker-task stack too small for Ed25519 signing

- **Status:** FIXED (library, found on hardware 2026-07-11 bringing up the HTTP/3/QUIC server on the PSRAM
  board; the first QUIC handshake panicked the board).
- **Symptom:** `h3_cert()` + `begin()` come up (`h3_cert=1`, `BEGIN=1`) and the QUIC listener binds UDP/443,
  but the first client handshake reboots the board: `Guru Meditation ... Core 1 panic'ed (Unhandled debug
exception)` - a task **stack canary** trip, no clean assert message.
- **Root cause (JTAG addr2line of the backtrace):** the crash is deep in Ed25519 signing during the QUIC
  TLS-1.3 CertificateVerify: `quic_server_poll -> quic_conn_recv -> quic_tls_recv_crypto ->
process_client_hello -> tls13_build_cert_verify -> ssh_ed25519_sign -> ed_scalarbase/scalarmult/add ->
ssh_gf_mul`. The QUIC TLS-1.3 handshake **reuses the SSH ed25519 signer**, whose software field
  arithmetic peaks at ~10.5 KB of stack. `quic_server_poll` runs on the **worker task**, whose default
  stack is only 8 KB unless SSH is enabled - and there was a compile guard forcing >= 12 KB
  (`PC_WORKER_STACK_CURVE_MIN`) for `PC_ENABLE_SSH` but **not for `PC_ENABLE_HTTP3`**, even though
  HTTP/3 exercises the same signer. So an HTTP/3-without-SSH build got the 8 KB default and overflowed.
- **Fix:** `protocore_config.h` - `PC_ENABLE_HTTP3` now bumps the default `PC_WORKER_TASK_STACK` to 12 KB
  (same as SSH) and is included in the `PC_WORKER_STACK_CURVE_MIN` build guard. After the fix the QUIC
  handshake completes (`QUIC handshake: CONNECTED` from an aioquic client) with no crash.
- **Lesson:** a shared crypto primitive imposes its stack floor on **every** feature that reaches it -
  when a new caller (HTTP/3) reuses SSH's ed25519, it must inherit SSH's stack guard, not just the code.

## TLS: handshake crashes on a core-locking lwIP core (arduino 3.x / PSRAM) - `tcp_write` called without the core lock

- **Status:** FIXED (library, found on hardware 2026-07-11 running HTTP/2-over-TLS on the rebuilt PSRAM
  core, IDF 5.5; the TLS handshake rebooted the board on every connection).
- **Symptom:** the TLS server starts, but the first record flush during the handshake panics/reboots:
  `assert failed: tcp_write ... "Required to lock TCPIP core functionality!"`. On the stock PlatformIO
  arduino-2.x core the same firmware handshakes fine.
- **Root cause:** lwIP has two threading models and the framework picks one. **Mailbox** (arduino 2.x /
  IDF 4.x, `CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING` off): `tcpip_api_call` marshals the op to one dedicated
  `tcpip` thread. **Core-locking** (arduino 3.x / IDF 5.x, the PSRAM core, flag on): `tcpip_api_call`
  instead takes the core lock and runs the op **inline on the calling task**. `pc_tcp_marshal`'s
  "am I already in a safe context, so run inline instead of marshaling" test was `on_tcpip_thread()` =
  a **task-handle compare** (captured on the first `pc_tcp_do`). That is correct for the mailbox model,
  but under core-locking the captured "tcpip task" is just whichever task ran the first op, so the test
  false-positives for a normal caller (the handshake pump) and runs `pc_tcp_do` -> `tcp_write` **without
  holding the core lock** -> the assert. (This path never worked on core-locking cores; it is why CI only
  _compiles_ arduino 3.x. It surfaced now because the PSRAM core is the first core-locking build actually
  HW-run with TLS.)
- **Fix:** `tcp.cpp` `on_tcpip_thread()` now branches on `LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING`. Core-locking: use
  lwIP's own holder query `sys_thread_tcpip(LWIP_CORE_LOCK_QUERY_HOLDER)` (the exact predicate
  `LWIP_ASSERT_CORE_LOCKED` uses) - a direct lwIP call is safe iff we hold the lock. Mailbox: the
  original task-handle compare, **byte-identical**, so the shipped 2.x path cannot regress.
- **Verified:** on the PSRAM/IDF-5.5 core the TLS handshake now completes and **HTTP/2 (ALPN `h2`) is
  served**: `curl -k` -> `HTTP 200 ver=2`, `openssl -alpn h2` -> `ALPN protocol: h2` (TLS 1.2),
  `curl --http2` -> `200`. Both static pools live in PSRAM (`s_h2`@0x3c0e0000, `s_pool`@0x3c0fcf30),
  internal DRAM 18%. This also fixes TLS on the stock arduino-esp32 3.x core (same core-locking model).
- **Lesson:** "am I in a context where a direct lwIP call is safe" is a **per-threading-model** question -
  detect the model, don't assume a dedicated tcpip thread exists. [[no-spaghetti-piping]]

## TLS: device HARD-HANGS on a TLS 1.3-leading ClientHello (tcpip_thread self-deadlock in the close path)

- **Status:** FIXED (library, found on hardware 2026-07-11 bringing up the TLS device-as-server interop peer
  against an ESP32-S3; a real 1.3-leading client from `curl`/OpenSSL/Python wedged the whole board).
- **Symptom:** a forced-TLS-1.2 client handshakes and serves `200 OK` fine, but a default client (which leads
  with TLS 1.3) leaves the device **completely dead** - no ping, all ports closed, **no panic and no watchdog
  reboot** (a silent hard hang, not a crash). A single attempt could wedge it.
- **Root cause (caught live over JTAG/GDB):** the lwIP `tcpip_thread` self-deadlocks. A raw lwIP `sent`
  callback (`lowlevel_sent_cb`, which runs **in** `tcpip_thread`) finalizes a closing slot ->
  `pc_tls_conn_end()` -> `mbedtls_ssl_close_notify()` -> `server_bio_send()` -> `pc_conn_raw_send()` ->
  `pc_tcp_marshal(RAWSEND)` -> `tcpip_api_call()` -> `sys_arch_sem_wait()` **forever**: it marshals a raw
  write onto `tcpip_thread` and blocks on the mailbox semaphore that only `tcpip_thread` can post - but the
  caller _is_ `tcpip_thread`. The reentrancy guard `TransportCtx::in_tcpip_thread` was set only inside
  `pc_tcp_do()`, so raw lwIP callbacks (which never enter through `pc_tcp_do`) read it as `false` and
  wrongly re-marshal. (UDP got this right - its flag is set in the recv trampoline; TCP missed the raw
  callbacks.) Every task that then touches lwIP (the worker's `pc_conn_detach`) also blocks on the dead
  `tcpip_thread`, so the whole stack dies.
- **Fix:** `tcp.cpp` - replace the "inside `pc_tcp_do`" boolean with the **actual `tcpip_thread` task
  handle** (captured the first time `pc_tcp_do` runs) and compare `xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle()` against it in
  `on_tcpip_thread()`. `pc_tcp_marshal()` now owns the context decision for **every** op: run `pc_tcp_do`
  inline when already in `tcpip_thread` (any raw callback), else `tcpip_api_call`. This is correct for raw
  callbacks that `in_tcpip_thread` never covered and kills the whole deadlock class, not just close_notify.
- **Lesson:** a reentrancy flag that only some entry points set is a latent self-deadlock; detect the thread
  by identity (task handle), not by "did I come through my own dispatcher." Mock-seam host tests can't see
  this - it only appears with a real TLS client on hardware. [[no-spaghetti-piping]] [[hw-testing-finds-integration-bugs]]

## TLS: a modern (TLS 1.3) ClientHello is refused because it exceeds the 1024 B RX ring

- **Status:** FIXED (library, found on hardware 2026-07-11, same bring-up; distinct from the deadlock above).
- **Symptom (after the deadlock fix):** the board no longer hangs but still **RSTs** any 1.3-leading
  ClientHello (`curl` -> `HTTP 000`, OpenSSL default -> handshake fails, read 0 bytes) while a `-no_tls1_3` /
  max-1.2 client succeeds. OpenSSL reported writing a **1533-byte** ClientHello.
- **Root cause:** a modern TLS 1.3 ClientHello (key shares + cipher/sig-alg lists + RFC 7685 padding) is
  ~1.5 KB and arrives in one TCP segment **larger than the whole `RX_BUF_SIZE` (1024 B) ring**. The recv
  callback refuses a segment that will not fit the ring (`ERR_MEM`, lossless backpressure), so a ClientHello
  bigger than the ring is refused **forever** and the handshake stalls until the idle-timeout reaper RSTs it.
  A 1.2-only ClientHello is small enough to fit, which is why it squeaked through. The ring was smaller than
  a single MSS segment - a latent limit a big handshake exposes (SSH's ~1.5 KB KEXINIT already had the same
  auto-upsize).
- **Fix:** `protocore_config.h` - when `PC_ENABLE_TLS` and `RX_BUF_SIZE` was left at its default, upsize it to
  **2048** (mirrors the existing SSH KEXINIT upsize). An explicit `RX_BUF_SIZE` build flag is honored. After
  both fixes: `curl` -> `200`, interop peer 7/7 (TLS 1.2 ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384), 20/20 default
  handshakes negotiate 1.2 with the board staying alive, 10/10 rapid curls `200`.
- **Lesson:** the RX ring must hold at least one full MSS segment; a handshake whose first flight is one big
  segment (TLS ClientHello, SSH KEXINIT) will otherwise be refused-forever by all-or-nothing segment
  backpressure. [[stress-test-before-ship]]

---

## Rig route table overflowed MAX_ROUTES (16) - silently dropped /ws, /events, /secure, /syslog/probe

- **Status:** FIXED (rig-firmware config, found on hardware 2026-07-11 while adding the syslog `/syslog/probe`
  route - it 404'd even though the new firmware was live, since its `/bench` field was present).
- **Root cause:** `PC` has a fixed flat route table of `MAX_ROUTES` (default **16**); `server.on()`
  / `on_ws()` / `on_sse()` / `dav()` each consume one slot and **return false (silently) when the table is
  full** - the app does not check the return. The rig had grown to **20 registrations** (dav + 17 handlers +
  ws + sse), so the four registered after slot 16 (`/syslog/probe`, `/secure`, `/ws`, `/events`) never took
  effect. The overflow first occurred at the FTP tick (when the count crossed 16), silently disabling the
  rig's WebSocket + SSE + auth surface from then on (those dims were covered in earlier ticks, so no false
  coverage was claimed, but the rig had regressed).
- **Fix:** rig `platformio.ini` `-DMAX_ROUTES=28` (test-firmware config; not a library change). Verified on
  the rig: `/syslog/probe` now registers (7/7 interop), and `/secure` -> 401 + `/events` -> 200 are back.
- **Lesson:** this is not a library defect (the fixed table + false-on-full is the documented O(MAX_ROUTES)
  design), but `server.on()`'s return value is worth checking in apps that register many routes. Whenever a
  new rig route 404s while a fresh `/bench` field proves the new firmware is live, suspect the route table is
  full before anything else. Watch the count as more device-as-client probes accumulate.
- **Sequel (2026-07-11, NTP tick):** the **same class** bit the UDP side - `PC_MAX_UDP_LISTENERS` defaults
  to **2** (CoAP 5683 + SNMP 161 filled it), so `ntp_server_begin()`'s `pc_udp_listen(123)` returned false
  and the rig serial printed `NTP=bind-failed`. Fixed with `-DPC_MAX_UDP_LISTENERS=4`. Same rule: fixed
  pools that fail closed need their cap raised as the rig accretes protocols - check UDP listeners too, not
  just the HTTP route table.

## syslog MSG CR/LF passthrough (log-forging) - AUDITED, INFO-level (caller's responsibility, spec-permitted)

- **Status:** NOT A LIBRARY BUG (audited 2026-07-11 via the new `syslog_injection` attack; recorded INFO).
- **Observed:** `syslog_format()` copies the caller's MSG verbatim into the RFC 5424 line (`... - - - %s`),
  so a message containing CR/LF/control bytes is emitted as-is. At a collector that splits a stream/file on
  newlines this enables log forging (CWE-117): the attack sent `legit\r\n<34>1 - evil ... FORGED-RECORD` and
  the collector received it verbatim in one datagram.
- **Why it is INFO, not a finding:** over UDP (RFC 5426) **one datagram = one syslog message**, and RFC 5424
  §6.4 permits any characters in MSG, so a _compliant_ receiver treats the whole datagram as one MSG and does
  not split on `\n` - the passthrough does not break a compliant peer or violate the spec. CWE-117 output
  neutralization is the responsibility of the code that logs untrusted data (the caller), which is why the
  attack records it as INFO. The device stayed up and the fixed `PC_SYSLOG_MSG_MAX` (256 B) bound held
  (a 2 KB message was refused: `syslog_format` -> 0, no datagram, largest observed datagram 80 B).
- **Optional hardening (deferred, not done):** `syslog_format` _could_ replace control bytes in MSG with a
  safe char for defense-in-depth (many production syslog clients do). Left as caller responsibility per the
  library's "the app owns the log content" model; revisit if a user wants built-in sanitization.
- **Sequel (2026-07-11, statsd tick):** the **same class** applies to the StatsD client - `statsd_format`
  copies the metric name verbatim, and StatsD packs multiple `\n`-separated metrics per UDP packet, so a
  newline in the name forges extra metrics at a _compliant_ collector (and a `:` / `|` corrupts the
  `name:value|type` split). Recorded INFO by the `statsd_injection` attack; same verdict - the caller sanitizes
  the metric name. The fixed `PC_STATSD_LINE_MAX` (256 B) bound holds (a 2 KB name is dropped, largest
  observed datagram 51 B), so there is no over-read - only the app-level forging concern.

## Outbound-client-path first-touch heap drop (FTP + SMTP) - INVESTIGATED, NOT A BUG (one-time warmup)

- **Status:** NOT A BUG (investigated on hardware 2026-07-11 while adding the `ftp_malicious_server` and
  `smtp_malicious_server` attacks - both showed the identical signature).
- **Found:** the first-ever run of each device-as-client attack against a freshly-booted S3 rig flagged the
  heap-drift oracle: free heap fell ~1344-2016 B (e.g. FTP 131836 -> 130044; SMTP 131356 -> 130012) and
  **stayed down** past the 6 s settle, which the oracle reports as a determinism-promise violation ("no heap
  allocation after begin()").
- **Why it is not a leak:** the drop is a **one-time lazy warmup** of the outbound-client TCP path
  (`pc_client_*` -> lwIP), which `begin()` never exercises - the server listener path is warm at boot, but the
  first _outbound_ connect+send (and, for SMTP, the first rapid connect+error+close churn) grows lwIP's TX pbuf
  / working-set backing once. Proof it is bounded, not monotonic: (1) for FTP, 8 more failed-open `/ftp/probe`
    - 8 more `/redis/probe` connections dropped **nothing** further (plateaued at 130044); (2) the **second and
      third identical attack runs were clean - 0 findings**, heap steady within a ~4 B jitter (FTP 130044 ->
      130044; SMTP 130012 -> 130008 -> 130012). A real per-connection leak would fall by another ~1.5 KB each run.
      The library's own code allocates nothing after `begin()`; the one-time growth is inside esp-idf/lwIP pools
      and is capped.
- **Lesson:** the heap-drift oracle's first-touch false-positive fires the first time _any_ never-before-used
  code path runs after begin() (here the outbound-client path). Distinguish warmup from a leak by re-running:
  warmup plateaus immediately and the second run is clean; a leak is monotonic. The MQTT/Redis device-as-client
  probes were judged clean earlier only because their path was already warm by the time the oracle sampled.
  (SMTP's warmup fired even after the interop happy-path had run, because the attack's error/close churn hits a
  slightly different lwIP allocation - so re-run per _attack_, not just per code path.)

## SSE teardown slot leak wedges the whole HTTP server (sse_free never called)

- **Status:** FIXED (found on hardware 2026-07-11 by the pentest rig's new `sse_exhaustion` attack).
- **Found:** `penetration_testing/pc_pentest.py --only sse_exhaustion` against the S3 rig (`penetration_testing/rig_firmware`,
  pinned `espressif32@6.13.0`, MAX_CONNS=4, MAX_SSE_CONNS=2). A **single clean run** on a freshly-booted,
  healthy board (heap 252636) drove the server permanently unresponsive: `/health` -> `56` then `28`
  (timeout), no recovery past `CONN_TIMEOUT_MS` (5 s), and **no crash/reboot** (serial clean) - a hard wedge.
- **Symptom:** one burst of `GET /events` connections beyond `MAX_SSE_CONNS` and the device stops answering
  every endpoint, forever, without rebooting (so no watchdog catches it). A remotely-triggerable permanent DoS.
- **Root cause (JTAG-confirmed):** `sse_free()` had **zero callers** - dead code. WebSocket teardown is wired
  (`ws_free()` in `protocore.cpp` handle loop), but SSE had no equivalent, so a closed / idle-reaped / aborted
  SSE stream never released its `sse_pool` entry. An SSE upgrade also leaves the slot as `ProtoConn::PROTO_HTTP`
  (SSE is a long-lived HTTP response, not a protocol switch), so the leaked binding persists on the HTTP slot.
  The kill step is in `http_poll_slot()`: `if (sse_find(i)) return;` skips HTTP dispatch for a slot it believes
  is a live SSE stream. Once `sse_pool` is full of leaked entries (slot_id 0,1), any **new** HTTP connection
  reusing conn slot 0 or 1 matches the stale `sse_find()` and is silently never dispatched -> the client hangs.
  Live JTAG on a wedged board: `sse_pool[0]`+`sse_pool[1]` both `active` (paths `/events`), `conn_pool[1]`
  already `CONN_FREE` (stale binding to a freed slot), a `GET /health` curl sat unparsed in a slot's rx ring,
  and `conn_pool[0].last_activity_ms` climbed 163048 -> 423695 across two halts (each hung-then-retried
  connection refreshed it), so the idle sweep never reaped it. `loopTask`/`worker`/`tcpip_thread` all alive.
- **Fix:** `src/network_drivers/presentation/presentation.c` - new `http_release_upgrade_bindings(slot)` calls
  `ws_free(slot)` + `sse_free(slot)` (both no-ops when unbound). Invoked from `http_evt_close()` (FIN/RST/error
  on an SSE or WS slot frees its binding) **and** `http_conn_open()` (a reused slot must not inherit a stale
  binding - covers the idle-sweep / abort free paths that never fire a close event). Verified on the rig: the
  exact `sse_exhaustion` burst that permanently wedged the board now recovers (`/health` -> 200 within ~5 s);
  native `test_sse` (+2 regression tests) and `test_presentation` green.
- **Lesson:** every presentation-layer binding (WS/SSE) needs a teardown wired to **every** transport free path,
  not just the graceful protocol-close path; clean up stale bindings at slot **reuse** to cover the direct-free
  paths (idle sweep, abort) that never emit a close event. Also: the liveness oracle must settle-recheck so a
  permanent wedge (stays down) is distinguished from a connection-holding attack's transient pool saturation
  (recovers) - the same discriminator that proved the fix.

## Basic-auth password compared with strcmp: NUL-truncating + not constant-time

- **Status:** FIXED (found on hardware 2026-07-11 by the pentest rig's `auth_bypass` attack).
- **Found:** `penetration_testing/pc_pentest.py --only auth_bypass` against the S3 rig. Sending
  `Authorization: Basic base64("admin:admin\x00GARBAGE")` returned **200** on the protected route.
- **Symptom:** a submitted password of the form `correct-password` + `\0` + junk authenticated, because
  `check_basic_auth` compared the password with `strcmp(pass, r->auth_pass)` and `strcmp` stops at the
  first embedded NUL - so `"admin\0GARBAGE"` compared equal to `"admin"`.
- **Severity:** LOW as a direct exploit (the attacker still has to submit the correct password prefix, so
  it grants no access they could not already get), but a real robustness + **timing-side-channel** weakness:
  `strcmp`/`memcmp` early-out, leaking via response timing how many leading credential bytes matched, and the
  NUL truncation means the decoded credential length was not validated.
- **Root cause:** `src/network_drivers/application/auth/auth.c check_basic_auth` used `memcmp` for the username (length-checked, ok)
  but `strcmp` for the password, and never bounded the password to its decoded byte length.
- **Fix:** compute the real password byte length (`plen = n - (pass - decoded)`) and compare BOTH fields with
  a new constant-time, length-bounded `ct_equal()` - so an embedded NUL cannot truncate the compare and the
  byte loop always runs to completion (no timing early-out). Verified: native test_auth/test_digest_auth green
  (261), and on the rig the null-truncation vector now returns 401.
- **Lesson:** never compare a secret with `strcmp`/`memcmp` - use a length-bounded constant-time equality.
  A password check must be validated against its actual byte length, not a C-string terminator.

---

## Connection pool wedges (no recovery) under a saturation + RST-race flood - was masked by the crash

- **Status:** FIXED (library) - the remediation is implemented at
  `src/network_drivers/transport/tcp.c` `lowlevel_recv_cb`: the idle-timer refresh
  (`slot->last_activity_ms = pc_millis()`) now sits **after** the backpressure check, and the
  refused-segment branch explicitly does not refresh (it returns `ERR_MEM` without touching the
  timer), so a no-progress connection idle-times-out and is reaped. HW re-attack with the pentest
  rig (`http_conn_saturation` + oversized lines, then confirm the pool recovers past CONN_TIMEOUT_MS)
  is the remaining validation.
- **Found:** re-attacking the S3 rig after the stale-pcb crash fix below. `http_conn_saturation` + a burst of
  oversized requests closed with SO_LINGER=0 (RST) leaves the device **pingable but not serving HTTP**
  (curl -> `000`), and it does **not** recover on its own past `CONN_TIMEOUT_MS` (5 s) - only a reset brings
  the server back. A fresh boot serves normally (`/health` -> 200), so the fix does not break normal HTTP.
- **Why it surfaced now:** the stale-pcb crash used to **reboot and self-heal** this exact wedge; fixing the
  crash removed that accidental recovery, exposing that the 4-slot pool's slots do not free under abnormal
  (RST-race / half-open saturation) teardown. Fixing one bug uncovered the one it was hiding.
- **Root cause (JTAG-confirmed):** the idle-timeout timestamp is refreshed on _raw recv activity_ instead of
  _accepted-data progress_. `lowlevel_recv_cb` set `slot->last_activity_ms = pc_millis()` **before** the
  backpressure check. An oversized request line (or any body larger than `RX_BUF_SIZE`) fills the RX ring; the
  segment is refused (`ERR_MEM`, kept as lwIP `refused_data`) and **redelivered every retransmit**. Each
  redelivery refreshed `last_activity_ms`, so `check_timeouts` always saw the slot as recently active and never
  reaped it. Live JTAG breakpoint at the reap check on a wedged slot: `now=810066`, `last_act=806956`,
  `diff=3110 < timeout=5000` (and `last_act` climbing 358768 -> 806956 across samples = being refreshed). Four
  such slots leak and permanently wedge the 4-slot pool. A Slowloris-class DoS.
- **Fix:** move the `last_activity_ms` refresh in `lowlevel_recv_cb` to **after** the backpressure check, so a
  refused/redelivered segment does not refresh the idle timer - only data actually accepted into the ring (real
  progress) does. A no-progress connection now idle-times-out and is reaped; a legitimately backpressured
  connection the worker is draining still refreshes on each accepted segment.
- **Lesson:** (1) a crash that reboots can _mask_ a resource-leak DoS - fix crashes, then re-attack to find what
  the reboot was hiding. (2) an idle/liveness timer must be driven by _progress_, not raw I/O events: refreshing
  on a refused/retransmitted segment lets a stalled peer hold a slot forever.

---

## Oversized request line / connection saturation reboots the device (tcp_output on a stale pcb)

- **Status:** FIXED (library) - the remediation is implemented in
  `src/network_drivers/transport/tcp.c` `pc_tcp_do`: `pcb_still_bound()` (and the O(1)
  `k->pcb == conn_pool[k->slot].pcb` check for the slot-carrying SEND/OUTPUT ops) re-validates the
  captured pcb at execution time on `tcpip_thread`; a stale pcb skips with `ERR_CLSD` instead of
  calling `tcp_write`/`tcp_output` on freed memory. HW re-attack with the pentest rig
  (`http_oversized_request_line` + `http_conn_saturation`, confirm no panic + no heap drift) is the
  remaining validation.
- **Found:** `penetration_testing/pc_pentest.py --host <rig> --diag` (attacks `http_oversized_request_line` +
  `http_conn_saturation`) against the ESP32-S3 rig firmware (`penetration_testing/rig_firmware`, pinned
  `espressif32@6.13.0`, MAX_CONNS=4). Reproduced standalone with ~15 oversized-request-line connections.
- **Symptom:** the device **panics and reboots**. Serial:
  `assert failed: tcp_output .../lwip/src/core/tcp_out.c:1249 (tcp_output: invalid pcb)` + backtrace +
  `rst:0xc (RTC_SW_CPU_RST)`. The determinism oracle also saw free heap drift down (251904 -> 245136)
  before the crash, and legitimate requests hang while the pool is saturated.
- **Root cause:** `src/network_drivers/transport/tcp.c:232`, `pc_tcp_do()` (the `tcpip_api_call`
  marshalled raw-lwIP op) calls `tcp_output(k->pcb)` - and `tcp_write(k->pcb, ...)` for SEND/RAWSEND -
  **without re-validating that `k->pcb` is still live**. The worker captures the pcb, then marshals the
  op to `tcpip_thread`; in between, the connection can be torn down (RST / lwIP error callback / close
  nulls `conn_pool[slot].pcb`), leaving `k->pcb` stale. `tcp_output` on the freed/closed pcb trips lwIP's
  assertion and panics. Symbolized via `addr2line` on the `-g` rig `firmware.elf`:
  `0x420074c6 = pc_tcp_do (tcp.cpp:232) -> tcp_output (tcp_out.c:1251) -> __assert_func`.
- **Fix:** (implemented) re-validate the pcb at execution time inside `pc_tcp_do` for the SEND /
  RAWSEND / OUTPUT ops - skip with `ERR_CLSD` when the captured pcb is no longer the slot's live pcb
  (`pcb_still_bound()` scans the pool for RAWSEND, whose slot is 0; SEND/OUTPUT do the O(1)
  `k->pcb == conn_pool[k->slot].pcb` compare). Both reads are on `tcpip_thread`, where teardown also
  runs, so the compare is race-free. HW re-attack over JTAG to confirm the crash is gone is pending.
- **Lesson:** a marshalled/deferred raw-lwIP op MUST re-validate its pcb at execution time - the pcb it
  captured on another thread may have been freed by teardown before the op runs. Capturing a raw pointer
  across the worker -> tcpip_thread hop without a liveness re-check is a use-after-free waiting to happen.

---

## FTP command emitters used additive length checks that could wrap (buffer-overflow risk)

- **Status:** FIXED (native_ftp: 16 cases pass, byte-identical output; the change is behavior-preserving
  under the codec's own invariant and only hardens the helper against a hostile length).
- **Found:** 2026-07-10, SonarCloud flagged the additive bound in `ftp_emit`.
- **Symptom:** none in practice - every in-tree caller passes a `strnlen(_, cap)`-bounded length, so the
  sum never wrapped. The risk is latent: `ftp_emit`/`ftp_emit_uint`/`ftp_finish` are general helpers that
  take a raw `size_t` length, and a future caller passing a near-`SIZE_MAX` length would wrap the check.
- **Root cause:** the room check was written as `n + slen > cap`. With `n` and `slen` both `size_t`, a
  huge `slen` makes `n + slen` overflow to a small value that passes the check, after which
  `memcpy(buf + n, s, slen)` writes past `buf`.
- **Fix:** rewrote all three bounds as overflow-safe subtraction (`slen > cap - n`, `ri > cap - n`,
  `n >= cap`). The codec keeps the invariant `n <= cap` on every non-sentinel return, so `cap - n` can
  never underflow; the checks are now provably safe for any length.
- **Lesson:** never bound a write with `offset + len > cap` when `len` is (or could become) untrusted -
  use the subtraction form `len > cap - offset` and keep the `offset <= cap` invariant that makes it safe.

---

## server.listen() returned PC_OK instead of the listener id (port-forward never matched)

- **Status:** FIXED (HW: the relay/DNAT example now forwards a file byte-exact through the ESP32;
  native_app + native_relay pass with the corrected return).
- **Found:** 2026-07-10, on hardware, testing PortForward against a real HTTP origin.
- **Symptom:** a connection to the published front port was accepted then RST with nothing relayed;
  `relay_on_accept`'s bind lookup found no bind, so it closed the connection. The origin never saw the
  request. No handler output at all, which made it look like the event was dropped.
- **Root cause:** `PC::listen()` returned `PC_OK` - which is **1**, not 0 - but the relay
  example (and `relay_listener.h`'s own docs) treat the return as the listener id passed to
  `pc_relay_publish()`. `begin()` assigns the actual listener index (0 for the only listener), so the
  bind was stored under id 1 while the accepted slot carried id 0; `bind_by_listener()` missed.
- **Fix:** `listen()` now returns the listener id (its index, `_listener_count - 1`) on success; errors
  stay negative. Updated the two tests that asserted `== PC_OK` and the header doc.
- **Lesson:** an API whose documented use is "pass the return to publish()" must return that id, not a
  generic success sentinel - and `PC_OK == 1` turned it into an off-by-one that only bit when the
  listener was not index 1.

## SMB / DNC / relay / SMTP / SSH-forward could never connect (client transport stubbed out)

- **Status:** FIXED (HW: an ESP32-S3 SMB client now connects to a real Samba server - `pc_client_open`
  returns a valid slot instead of -1). Found by hardware testing; the host tests cannot catch it because
  they drive the engines through a mock send/recv seam, not the real `pc_client` transport.
- **Found:** 2026-07-10, first on-hardware run of the SmbFileClient example.
- **Symptom:** every outbound connection from an SMB (also DNC, relay/DNAT, SMTP, or SSH port-forward)
  build failed - `pc_client_open()` returned -1 on the very first call, so the feature silently never
  talked to its peer on device.
- **Root cause:** `client.cpp` compiles the real transport only under `#if defined(ARDUINO) &&
PC_NEED_DET_CLIENT`, else it falls through to a host stub whose `pc_client_open` returns -1.
  `PC_NEED_DET_CLIENT` was derived from only `HTTP_CLIENT || MQTT || WS_CLIENT`, omitting every newer
  feature that drives pc_client: the direct callers (relay, smtp, ssh port-forward) and the seam-based
  engines whose shipped example binds the seam to pc_client (smb, dnc). An SMB-only firmware got the stub.
- **Fix:** added `PC_ENABLE_RELAY || PC_ENABLE_SMTP || PC_SSH_PORT_FORWARD || PC_ENABLE_SMB ||
PC_ENABLE_DNC` to the `PC_NEED_DET_CLIENT` derivation (which also force-enables the shared DNS
  resolver), so any feature that needs the outbound transport pulls it in.
- **Lesson:** a "needs X" derived flag must list EVERY consumer, including features that reach the transport
  only through an example's seam binding; and a stub that returns an error instead of failing to link hides
  the omission until a board is on the bench.

## SMB client crashed the ESP32 during NTLMv2 auth (smb_open stack overflow)

- **Status:** FIXED (HW: the S3 read a file byte-exact - the fnv1a matched the server - after the buffers
  moved off the stack; native_smb host tests still pass).
- **Found:** 2026-07-10, on hardware, right after the pc_client fix let `smb_open` reach the real Samba
  NTLMv2 exchange.
- **Symptom:** "Guru Meditation Error ... Stack canary watchpoint triggered (loopTask)" inside
  `hmac_md5` <- `ntlm_ntowfv2` <- `smb_open`, in a boot loop. Host tests never saw it (the native stack is
  large and unguarded).
- **Root cause:** `smb_open` declared ~4 KB of working buffers on the stack (`tx` + `rx` = 2*PC_SMB_BUF,
  plus `nt_resp` + `ntauth` + `sp2` + `utf16` = 4*(PC_SMB_BUF/2)); `smb_read`/`smb_write` each add
  2*PC_SMB_BUF. With the caller's frame this overran the default 8 KB Arduino loopTask stack, tripping
  the canary during the deep NTLMv2 call chain.
- **Fix:** moved the large working buffers into one owned, feature-gated `SmbClientCtx` static (matching the
  library's owner-context pattern), leaving only small locals on the stack. The SMB dialogue is sequential
  (open -> read/write -> close) so a single shared working set is correct; documented as not reentrant
  across two concurrent SMB connections.
- **Lesson:** protocol clients with multi-KB working buffers must own them statically, not stack-allocate
  them - default embedded task stacks are ~8 KB and host tests will not reveal the overflow.

## Multipart parser truncated binary parts (strstr on a length-tracked binary body)

- **Status:** FIXED (native_app `test_binary_part_not_truncated` + all multipart cases pass; native_pentest
  38/38 clean under ASan + UBSan with the rewritten scan). Previously documented as a "known limitation";
  it is really a data-integrity bug and is now fixed.
- **Found:** 2026-07-10, reviewing the KNOWN_LIMITATIONS entry "a binary part containing the boundary bytes
  is truncated".
- **Symptom:** a multipart/form-data **file upload** whose body contains a NUL byte, or the raw boundary
  token (e.g. `--BND`) inside the payload, was truncated - the part's `data_len` stopped at the first NUL
  or the first boundary-looking bytes, corrupting binary uploads (images, firmware, ...).
- **Root cause:** `multipart_parse` scanned the body with `strstr` (`strstr(body, delim)` /
  `strstr(pos, "\r\n")`), which (1) stops at the first NUL even though `HttpReq::body` is a byte buffer with
  an explicit `body_len`, and (2) matched the bare `--boundary` bytes anywhere, so a payload that merely
  _contained_ those bytes (without the framing `CRLF`) was treated as a delimiter.
- **Fix:** rewrote the scan to be length-bounded over `body_len` with a binary-safe `mem_find` (memcmp, no
  NUL stop) and to match the full RFC 2046 `\r\n--boundary` delimiter for the data sections, so only a true
  `CRLF--boundary` ends a part. The in-place NUL terminator is kept as a convenience for text parts; binary
  parts are read via `part->data` + `part->data_len`.
- **Lesson:** never `strstr`/`strlen`-scan a buffer that is length-tracked and may hold binary - use a
  length-bounded `memcmp` search; and match the _full_ framed delimiter (`CRLF--boundary`), not the bare
  token, so payload bytes can never masquerade as a boundary.

## Signed-overflow UB + `10^exponent` DoS in the remaining hand-rolled number parsers

- **Status:** FIXED (native_pentest 35/35 clean under ASan + UBSan `-fno-sanitize-recover=all`,
  including new `pc_strtof` + GraphQL fuzz targets that feed huge exponents / integer literals;
  native_jwt 22/22 and native_exc_decoder 7/7 clean under UBSan). Completes the sweep started by the
  previous entry.
- **Found:** 2026-07-10, continuing the signed-`v*10` audit. Five more sites; two carried a second,
  worse bug: an exponent parsed into an `int` then applied as `for (k = 0; k < ex; k++) m *= 10.0` -
  a huge exponent (e.g. GraphQL `1e999999999`) is both signed-overflow UB **and** a denial-of-service
  (billions of iterations hang the device).
- **Sites + fix:**
    - `shared_primitives/numparse.h` `pc_strtof` and `services/iot/graphql/graphql.cpp` (query number
      literal): the exponent overflowed and its `10^ex` loop was unbounded - **clamped** the exponent
      (`if (ex < 400)` - 10^400 saturates the double to inf anyway), fixing UB + DoS. GraphQL's integer
      literal (`long long ipart`) also overflowed - now unsigned-accumulate.
    - `services/security/jwt/jwt.cpp` `jwt_claim_int` (untrusted numeric claim) and
      `server/exc_decoder.c` (crash-dump core id): the same signed `v*10` - fixed by
      unsigned-accumulate + reinterpret (jwt) / clamp (exc_decoder).
- **Not a bug:** `network_drivers/network/ip.cpp:54` matched the grep but is bounded - the
  `if (digits >= 3) return false` guard caps the octet at 3 digits (<= 999), so `val*10` never
  overflows. Left as-is.
- **Lesson:** the same as the previous entry, plus: an exponent applied by a `10^ex` **loop** is a DoS
  vector independent of the overflow - always clamp a parsed exponent to the type's real range.

---

## Signed-integer-overflow UB in three untrusted-input number parsers

- **Status:** FIXED (native_pentest now passes clean under ASan + UBSan with
  `-fno-sanitize-recover=all`: 33/33; the directly-affected suites - native_primitives,
  native_redis, native_snmp, native_http_client - all still green).
- **Found:** 2026-07-09, by the extended pentest fuzzer. Adding OPC UA Binary fuzz targets and
  running the built binary directly under `-fno-sanitize-recover=all` (so UBSan aborts instead of
  just printing) surfaced three latent undefined-behavior sites that earlier runs had been printing
  and ignoring. All three are hit by feeding a parser a very long / hostile digit string.
- **Sites + root cause:**
    - `services/net/snmp/snmp_ber.cpp` `ber_read_integer`: sign-extended the BER INTEGER by seeding a
      signed `long v = -1` and then `v = (v << 8) | byte` - **left-shifting a negative signed value
      is UB** (C++ < 20).
    - `shared_primitives/numparse.h` `pc_strtol`: `v = v * 10 + digit` on a signed `long` - **signed
      overflow is UB** once the digits exceed `LONG_MAX` (the unsigned `pc_strtoul` was already safe).
    - `services/redis_resp.cpp` RESP integer + double parsers: the same `v = v * 10 + digit` on a
      signed `int64_t` (the integer) and an unbounded `int exp` accumulator (the exponent).
- **Fix:** accumulate in unsigned and reinterpret with sign (BER integer, `pc_strtol`, RESP
  integer - `neg ? (T)(0 - uv) : (T)uv`, which also avoids the negate-`MIN` UB), and clamp the RESP
  double exponent (`if (exp < 1000000)` - a larger exponent saturates the `double` to inf/0 anyway).
  All fixes are value-identical for in-range inputs, so no test changed.
- **Lesson:** a hand-rolled `v = v*10 + digit` (or a `neg_seed << 8`) on a **signed** accumulator is
  UB the moment an attacker supplies enough digits; parse untrusted numbers into an unsigned type and
  reinterpret, or clamp. The fuzzer only caught these once it ran the sanitized binary with
  `-fno-sanitize-recover=all` - printing-but-not-failing UBSan output had hidden them.

---

## DNC decoder ate the EIA digit `3` (0x13) as an XOFF flow-control byte

- **Status:** FIXED (caught pre-ship by the codec's own encode -> decode round-trip test;
  never released). `native_dnc` 13/13; the program "M30" now round-trips through the EIA
  code intact.
- **Found:** 2026-07-09, on the first run of `test_roundtrip_program` for the new CNC DNC
  codec (services/machine_tool/dnc): the EIA round-trip of `M30` came back as `M0` - the `3` vanished.
- **Symptom:** decoding an EIA-coded program silently dropped every digit `3`; any block
  containing a `3` was corrupted.
- **Root cause:** the block decoder (`dnc_decode_feed`) filtered XON/XOFF (DC1 0x11 / DC3
  0x13) out of the byte stream as flow control - but in the EIA RS-244 tape code the data
  character `3` **is** 0x13. Filtering it from the forward program stream deleted the digit.
  The design conflated two different channels: the forward program data (sender -> controller,
  what the decoder reassembles) and the reverse flow-control channel (controller -> sender,
  XON/XOFF). They are opposite directions of a full-duplex link and must not share a filter.
- **Fix:** removed the XON/XOFF filtering from `dnc_decode_feed` entirely; the decoder now
  decodes the forward stream faithfully (0x13 = the data byte `3`). Flow control lives only in
  `dnc_flow_feed`, which the caller drives from the **reverse** channel's bytes. Added
  `test_decode_eia_three_is_not_xoff` as a regression guard.
- **Lesson:** an in-band control code (ASCII DC3) can collide with a data code in a different
  character set (EIA `3`); never filter control bytes out of a data stream that may legitimately
  contain that byte value. Keep flow control on its own channel.

## Owner-context grouping anchored the server TLS config + worker queue store (Arduino 3.x DRAM)

- **Status:** FIXED (WebSocketClient builds on the arduino-esp32 3.x core - 37% DRAM, was 408 bytes
  over; HTTPS/mTLS/TlsResumption/SecureWebSocket + SSH still build; native_ssh /
  native_crypto_kat 154/154).
- **Found:** 2026-07-07, after the scratch-arena fix cleared the ESP32 (PIO 2.x) build and 4 of the 5
  Arduino (3.x) failures. The last, `WebSocketClient` (a TLS WebSocket _client_), still overflowed
  `dram0_0_seg` by 408 bytes - but only on the arduino-esp32 3.x core, whose larger core footprint
  leaves less headroom than the 2.x core the PlatformIO job uses.
- **Symptom:** an outbound-only WebSocket client linked ~900 bytes of server-only state it never uses:
  the linked-map/cref diff (base vs HEAD) showed `tls.cpp` +600, `worker.cpp` +160, `listener.cpp`
  +145. Two more instances of the same gc-liveness trap as the scratch arena.
- **Root cause:** small always-referenced fields grouped into large owned `Ctx` symbols, so
  `--gc-sections` (per-symbol) could not drop the big cold parts:
    - `TlsServerCtx` bundled a 1-byte `ready` flag with the ~600-byte mbedTLS server config/cert/key/
      ticket. `pc_tls_ready()` (called on the client path) reads `ready`, anchoring the whole server
      config into a client that never runs `pc_tls_configure()`.
    - `DeferCtx` bundled the per-worker FreeRTOS queue **handles** (hot; `pc_defer()` pushes to them)
      with the multi-hundred-byte static queue **storage** (only `pc_workers_start()` touches it), so
      the storage stayed linked in a build that never starts workers.
- **Fix:** split each into a hot symbol + a cold symbol - `TlsServerReadyCtx s_srv_ready` apart from
  `TlsServerCtx s_srv`; `DeferStorageCtx s_defer_store` apart from `DeferCtx s_defer`. The cold halves
  are now referenced only by server-setup / worker-start code and garbage-collect out of client-only
  firmwares. Server examples that do use them are unchanged (HTTPS DRAM identical). Both new types
  end in `Ctx`, so the owner-context guard still passes. (`listener.cpp` +145 was left: the two splits
  already reclaimed far more than the 408-byte deficit.)
- **Lesson (reinforced):** verify on the tightest target - the arduino-esp32 3.x core overflows where
  the 2.x core has room. Keep large conditionally-used buffers in their own owned symbol, separate
  from small always-referenced fields. See the scratch-arena entry below for the first instance.

## Owner-context grouping anchored the 8 KB scratch arena, overflowing TLS-example DRAM

- **Status:** FIXED (all four TLS examples - HTTPS, mTLS, TlsResumption, SecureWebSocket -
  build for esp32dev again; native_ssh 146/146 and the SSH scratch-consumer build still pass).
- **Found:** 2026-07-06, RCA'ing why ESP32 Build / Arduino Build were red. Last green at `f7767ba6`,
  first red at `23e0797b` - both owner-context-refactor commits.
- **Symptom:** the four largest TLS examples failed to link: `.dram0.bss will not fit in region
dram0_0_seg`, overflowed by 944-1264 bytes. A per-object `.o` size diff showed only +62 bytes of
  DRAM growth across the whole tree, which could not explain a ~1 KB overflow.
- **Root cause:** a `--gc-sections` **liveness** change, invisible to a compiled-size diff (the object
  is compiled in both trees; only its _linkage_ differs). The scratch owner-sweep merged three separate
  symbols - the 8 KB per-worker bump `arena`, the `off[]` offsets, and `high_water[]` - into one
  `struct ScratchCtx s_scratch`. `session.cpp` calls `scratch_reset()` **every dispatch**, touching only
  `off[]`; but `off[]` and the arena were now one symbol/section, and `--gc-sections` is per-section, so
  that always-live reference anchored the whole 8 KB. Previously the arena was its own symbol, referenced
  only by `scratch_alloc()`, which is dead code in a plain TLS/HTTP build (its callers are SSH / WebSocket
  / OIDC) - so the linker dropped it. The linked-map diff was unambiguous: `scratch.cpp` contributed
  **8 bytes** of DRAM at `f7767ba6` and **8228 bytes** at HEAD. That +8 KB tipped the already
  DRAM-marginal TLS examples (~122 KB `dram0_0_seg` ceiling) over.
- **Fix:** split the arena back into its own owned instance (`struct ScratchArenaCtx s_scratch_arena`),
  keeping only the small `off[]`/`high_water[]` metadata in `ScratchCtx`. `scratch_alloc()` is the sole
  referrer of the arena, so a firmware that never allocates scratch garbage-collects both again; the
  always-live `scratch_reset()` anchors only the tiny metadata. Both are `*Ctx` types, so the
  owner-context guard still passes. Semantics are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Lesson:** when consolidating globals into one owned `Ctx`, keep a large _conditionally-used_ buffer
  in a **separate** owned symbol from small _always-referenced_ fields, or `--gc-sections` can no longer
  drop the buffer from builds that never use it. Measure regressions with the **linked** map, not a
  compiled `.o` size sum.

## Ed25519 verify accepted non-canonical S (signature malleability)

- **Status:** FIXED (native_crypto_kat green: the Wycheproof SignatureMalleability vectors now reject;
  native_ssh_ed25519 RFC 8032 7.1 regression still passes).
- **Found:** 2026-07-06, standing up the data-driven external crypto KAT env (native_crypto_kat) that
  runs Project Wycheproof vectors through the primitives. Wycheproof ed25519 tcId 63-70
  (`SignatureMalleability`) verified when they must be rejected.
- **Symptom:** `ssh_ed25519_verify` accepted a signature whose scalar S had been replaced by S + L
  (L = the group order). Because L\*B is the identity, `S*B - h*A` recomputes the same R, so the
  recompute-and-compare-R verification passed for both S and S + L - i.e. a third party could maul a
  valid signature into a different byte string that still verifies.
- **Root cause:** verification checked the group equation but never range-checked S. RFC 8032 5.1.7
  requires the verifier to reject a signature whose S is not in `[0, L)`; that check was missing.
- **Fix:** added `ed_scalar_canonical()` (compares the little-endian S against the group order `ED_L`
  from the top byte down) and reject up front in `ssh_ed25519_verify` when S >= L. Verification is
  public-data only, so a plain compare is fine. Legitimate signatures always have S < L (signing
  reduces mod L), so no valid vector or existing test changes.

## 54 shipped features were missing from the feature grid (FEATURES.md drift)

- **Status:** FIXED (gen_feature_tables.py coverage guard green; all PC_ENABLE\_\* flags now documented).
- **Found:** 2026-07-06, answering "did all the features make it into docs/FEATURES.md?".
- **Symptom:** 54 opt-in features had a `PC_ENABLE_*` flag, a `src/services/*` implementation, and
  tests, but no `##` heading in docs/FEATURES.md - so they were absent from the README/docs feature
  tables too (those tables are generated _from_ FEATURES.md). The whole industrial-protocol wave
  (HART, GOOSE, MMS, PROFINET, PROFIBUS, J2735, NTCIP, OpenADR, ...), HTTP/3, and several infra
  features (Failsafe, Sleep Scheduler, Wear Leveling, Network Adaptation, PSRAM Pool, Themes, ...)
  had shipped without ever being listed.
- **Root cause:** FEATURES.md is hand-maintained and nothing enforced that every feature flag has an
  entry. gen_feature_tables.py guarded the README tables against drift from FEATURES.md, but not
  FEATURES.md against drift from the config header, so shipped features silently never reached the grid
  (the same failure mode as the "silently lost 28 features" the generator docstring already warned of).
- **Fix:** backfilled all 54 entries (descriptions extracted verbatim from each flag's config-header
  doc comment) into FEATURES.md, mapped them to their OSI layer, regenerated the tables, and added a
  coverage guard to gen_feature_tables.py: it fails (in the Feature Tables CI job) if any
  `PC_ENABLE_*` flag lacks a FEATURES.md entry, excluding a small allowlist of internal derived
  flags (STREAM_BODY, CLIENT_TLS). Docs-only; no library code changed.

## HTTP/3 TLS flight append ignored its buffer cap (potential `flight_hs` overflow)

- **Status:** FIXED (native_quic_tls / native_tls13_msg / native_h3_e2e green; flagged by SonarCloud
  cpp:S3519 as two BLOCKER "memory copy overflows the destination buffer" findings).
- **Found:** 2026-07-06, reviewing the SonarCloud quality gate on the HTTP/3 handshake code.
- **Symptom:** the TLS 1.3 server flight is built message-by-message into a fixed `qt->flight_hs`
  buffer, each builder called with `sizeof(flight_hs) - flight_hs_len` as its capacity. `emit()` was
  handed that same capacity but ignored it (`(void)cap;`) and did `*plen += written` unconditionally.
- **Root cause:** nothing bounded `flight_hs_len` against `sizeof(flight_hs)`. In the correct flow each
  builder returns `<= cap`, so the sum stayed in bounds, but the invariant was never enforced: if a
  builder ever returned more than the remaining room, a later builder's `sizeof(flight_hs) -
flight_hs_len` would underflow to a huge `cap` and `w_bytes()` would `memcpy` past the fixed array.
- **Fix:** `emit()` now honors the `cap` contract it was given - it refuses an append that would run
  past the buffer (`written > cap - *plen`), maintaining the `*plen <= cap` invariant so the next
  builder's capacity subtraction can never underflow. `w_bytes()` also now checks `w->pos > w->cap`
  explicitly before the `w->cap - w->pos` bound so that subtraction provably cannot underflow even for
  a malformed `Writer`. Separately, the HTTP/3 DATA-frame coalescing in `dispatch_request()` now clamps
  with a room subtraction (`sizeof(body) - body_len`) instead of a `body_len + take` sum that could
  wrap. All three are the codebase's own overflow-safe idiom.

---

## QUIC anti-amplification checked after building, desyncing the flight under loss

- **Status:** FIXED (RPi netem loss interop + native_quic_conn; found while adding PTO loss recovery).
- **Found:** 2026-07-06, driving the HTTP/3 interop harness under 10-20% netem packet loss - a
  timer-polled server got _worse_ with loss, not better, and connections stalled.
- **Symptom:** under loss, `quic_conn_send()` advanced packet-number / CRYPTO-offset / stream-send
  state for a datagram it then discarded, so the retransmitted flight no longer matched what the peer
  had (or had not) received. Loss recovery made the stall worse instead of curing it.
- **Root cause:** the 3x anti-amplification check (RFC 9000 sec 8.1) ran _after_ `build_packet()` had
  already bumped `next_pn` / `crypto_tx_off` / `tx_sent` / `last_ae_pn`. When the send was then
  amplification-blocked and dropped, that state stayed advanced - a build-then-discard desync.
- **Fix:** move the amplification check to the top of `quic_conn_send()`, before any packet is built,
  so a blocked send advances no packet state. Also reset the PTO backoff on acknowledged progress
  (RFC 9002 sec 6.2) so a recovering connection does not keep doubling its probe interval.

---

## SSH outbound wire buffer under-sized for a near-max payload + long MAC

- **Status:** FIXED (native SSH suites green; found while adding s2c compression, which made the
  overflow reachable in the general case).
- **Found:** 2026-07-05, sizing the wire buffer for compression - the existing sizing did not cover
  the worst case even without compression.
- **Root cause:** `ssh_conn.cpp` sized every outbound wire buffer as `SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE +
SSH_HMAC_SHA256_LEN` (= 2080). A payload approaching `SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE` with the hmac-sha2-512 MAC
  (64-byte tag) needs `4 + (1 + payload + pad) + 64` ≈ 2128 bytes, so `ssh_pkt_send()` would hit its
  `wire_len > out_cap` guard and return -1, dropping the packet. Latent because real payloads
  (channel-data chunks bounded by the peer window) never approached the max. With s2c compression the
  effective payload can also expand slightly (fixed-Huffman on incompressible data), and a dropped
  packet mid-stream desyncs the stateful cipher / compression stream (session corruption), so the
  under-size had to be fixed properly rather than relied upon to never trigger.
- **Fix:** a single `SSH_WIRE_CAP` in `ssh_packet.h` sized for the true worst case - `4 + 1 +
SSH_MAX_EFFECTIVE_PAYLOAD + SSH_MAX_PAD(32) + SSH_MAX_MAC(64)`, where the effective payload grows to
  `ssh_deflate_bound(SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE)` when `PC_ENABLE_SSH_ZLIB` is set. All four wire buffers in
  `ssh_conn.cpp` use it. Correct for every cipher/MAC mode, compressed or not.

---

## UDP transport called raw lwIP off tcpip_thread (sibling of the listener bug)

- **Status:** FIXED (HW-validated on an ESP32-S3: the SNMP agent binds UDP/161 and runs;
  before, the same `udp_bind` from the app task would have asserted like the listener did).
- **Found:** 2026-07-04, immediately after the listener fix below - auditing for the same
  root cause in the UDP path, since UDP services bind at `begin()` from the app task too.
- **Root cause:** `udp.cpp` (`pc_udp_*`, the single place lwIP UDP is touched)
  called raw `udp_new` / `udp_bind` / `udp_recv` / `udp_remove` / `udp_sendto` **directly from
  the app task**, never marshaled. On arduino-esp32 3.x (lwIP core-locking) that trips
  `LWIP_ASSERT_CORE_LOCKED`, so every UDP service - SNMP agent (`:161`), CoAP, the captive-portal
  DNS responder (`:53`), syslog, UDP telemetry, flow-export - would crash at `begin()` / on send.
  Same latency story as the listener: harmless on the IDF-4.x board all runtime HW used, and CI
  only compiles the 3.x core. (The TCP transport `pc_tcp_do` and the outbound client `cc_do_*`
  were already marshaled; UDP was the remaining raw path.)
- **Fix:** marshal the UDP ops onto tcpip_thread via `tcpip_api_call()` (a `udp_do` dispatcher for
  listen / send / send-out), mirroring the TCP transport - including the `s_in_tcpip_thread` guard
  so a handler replying from the `udp_recv` trampoline (already in-thread) sends directly instead of
  re-marshaling (which would deadlock). All `pc_udp_*` callers are unchanged; the native host stubs
  are untouched. Native UDP-service suites green (`native_coap` / `native_snmp` / `native_dns_resolver`
  / `native_syslog`); HW: SNMP agent binds `:161` and the device runs on the modern core.
- **Prevention:** every raw lwIP `tcp_*` / `udp_*` from outside a lwIP callback now goes through
  `tcpip_api_call()`; the transport layer is the one owner of that rule (listener, TCP conn, UDP,
  client all marshal). See the listener entry below for the runtime-test-the-3.x-core lesson.

---

## Listener bring-up called raw lwIP off tcpip_thread, asserting on arduino-esp32 3.x

- **Status:** FIXED (HW-validated on an ESP32-S3: `begin_tls()` now starts the HTTPS
  listener and the server runs, where before it crash-looped at boot).
- **Found:** 2026-07-04, first on-hardware run of any listener on the arduino-esp32 **3.x**
  core (IDF 5.x) - surfaced while HW-proving the PSRAM TLS arena. The board booted, joined
  WiFi, then panicked in `begin_tls()`:
  `assert failed: tcp_alloc ...lwip/src/core/tcp.c:1854 (Required to lock TCPIP core functionality!)`,
  rebooting in a loop.
- **Root cause:** `listener_add()` / `listener_stop()` (the path `begin()` and `begin_tls()`
  use) called raw lwIP `tcp_new_ip_type` / `tcp_bind` / `tcp_listen_with_backlog` / `tcp_close`
  **directly from the app (setup/loop) task**, which is not `tcpip_thread` and does not hold the
  TCPIP core lock. arduino-esp32 3.x ships `CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING=1` +
  `CONFIG_LWIP_CHECK_THREAD_SAFETY=1`, so `LWIP_ASSERT_CORE_LOCKED` fires. It was latent because
  (1) all prior runtime HW testing used the classic ESP32 via PlatformIO (arduino 2.x / IDF 4.x),
  where the assert is compiled out and the unlocked call merely raced, and (2) the "Arduino Build"
  CI only **compiles** the 3.x core, never runs it. The _dynamic_ listener (SSH `ssh -R`) already
  marshaled correctly via `tcpip_api_call()`; the primary listener was the one unmarshaled path,
  written under a stale "this build has core-locking off" assumption.
- **Fix:** `listener_add()` / `listener_stop()` now route their create/close through the same
  `listener_lwip_marshal()` (`tcpip_api_call`) the dynamic listener uses, on ARDUINO. The raw path
  stays only for the native host build (no lwIP thread). This is correct on **both** cores: with
  core-locking it satisfies the lock; without it, it still removes the off-thread race. The stale
  comment was corrected.
- **Prevention:** HW test the modern (arduino-esp32 3.x) core at runtime, not only compile it -
  the core-locking assert only fires when the code actually runs. Any new raw lwIP `tcp_*` from a
  non-callback context must go through `tcpip_api_call()` (transport `pc_tcp_do` and the client
  `cc_do_*` were already correct; the listener now matches).

---

## SSH curve25519/ed25519 handshake overflowed the 8 KB worker task stack

- **Status:** FIXED (HW-validated on an ESP32-S3; the modern-crypto handshake completes with
  the raised default and ~1.8 KB of stack margin).
- **Found:** 2026-07-03, first on-hardware connect to the new curve25519-sha256 +
  ssh-ed25519 suite: the client reached `expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY` then
  `Connection reset by peer`, and the serial log showed
  `Guru Meditation Error: ... Stack canary watchpoint triggered (pc_worker)`.
- **Root cause:** the software field arithmetic for curve25519 (`ssh_x25519`) and ed25519
  (`ssh_ed25519_sign`), in radix-2^16 with many `ssh_gf` temporaries per frame, nests deeper
  than the finite-field DH/RSA path - plus the field inversion calls the mbedTLS bignum
  modexp at the bottom of that chain. Measured peak worker-task stack use is ~10.5 KB
  (`uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark`: a 16 KB stack left 5928 B free at the deepest point), which
  overflows the historical 8 KB worker default sized for the ~7 KB RSA path.
- **Fix:** `PC_WORKER_TASK_STACK` now defaults to 12288 when `PC_ENABLE_SSH` is set
  (8192 otherwise), a new `PC_WORKER_STACK_CURVE_MIN` (12288) documents the floor, and the
  compile-time guard enforces it for SSH builds (the RSA-only floor still applies to
  OIDC-only builds). Re-flashed at the shipped 12288 default: the curve25519 + ssh-ed25519 +
  ed25519-client-auth session runs to a data round-trip with 1832 B of stack free at peak, no
  canary trip; the DH-group14 + rsa-sha2-256 path is unchanged (both echo on hardware).
- **Prevention:** the worker stack is now sized from a measured high-water mark, not a guess,
  and a build-time `#error` catches any future lowering below the curve floor before it can
  reach the canary at runtime.

---

## SSH answered SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST with UNIMPLEMENTED instead of REQUEST_FAILURE

- **Status:** FIXED (`native_ssh` 127/127; the dispatcher now routes GLOBAL_REQUEST to a
  dedicated handler).
- **Found:** 2026-07-03, implementing `ssh -R` remote forwarding (which arrives as a
  `tcpip-forward` global request).
- **Root cause:** the SSH message dispatcher had no case for `SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST` (80),
  so every connection-wide request fell through to the default arm and got
  `SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED` (RFC 4253 §11.4). That is wrong: GLOBAL_REQUEST is a **known**
  message type - only the request _name_ may be unknown - and RFC 4254 §4 says an
  unrecognized request is answered with `SSH_MSG_REQUEST_FAILURE` when `want_reply` is set,
  or ignored otherwise. In practice this broke OpenSSH client keepalives
  (`keepalive@openssh.com`, `want_reply=true`): the client saw an UNIMPLEMENTED rather than a
  SUCCESS/FAILURE reply and could treat the keepalive as unanswered, and benign
  `want_reply=false` requests (`hostkeys-00@openssh.com`, `no-more-sessions@openssh.com`) drew
  a spurious UNIMPLEMENTED.
- **Fix:** `ssh_global_request_handle()` (ssh_channel) now parses the request name +
  `want_reply`, replies `REQUEST_FAILURE` (or stays silent) per §4, and routes
  `tcpip-forward` / `cancel-tcpip-forward` to an opt-in remote-forward seam (accepted only
  when an owner is installed; a port-0 bind echoes its allocated port per §7.1). Host-tested
  (`test_ssh_channel`: accept / refuse / port-0 echo / no-reply / cancel / unknown-request /
  malformed).
- **Prevention:** the seam is the plug-in point for the `ssh -R` listener + byte-bridge owner
  (the next phase); until it is installed the server correctly declines forwards rather than
  making a promise it cannot keep.

---

## Abuse-prevention state keyed on a 32-bit hash of the IPv6 source address (security)

- **Status:** FIXED (transport now carries the full family-tagged address; all IP-keyed
  features match the whole IPv4/IPv6 address; `native_ip` / `native_accept_gate` /
  `native_auth_lockout` / `native` green with added v6 coverage).
- **Found:** 2026-07-03, reviewing the IPv6 phase-2 work. Shipped in v4.87.0 (auth lockout)
  and v4.88.0 (per-IP throttle) - both superseded by this fix.
- **Root cause:** when IPv6 arrived, the per-IP throttle, the auth-lockout table, and the
  accept-time source key all reduced the peer address to a 32-bit value: a raw v4 word, and
  for v6 a **32-bit FNV-1a hash** (`pc_ip_key` / `pc_conn_remote_key` / `pc_lwip_ip_key`).
  In a security-forward library that is a real vulnerability, not a shortcut:
    - **Targeted lockout / throttle poisoning.** A 32-bit hash is trivially collidable, so an
      attacker can pick a v6 source that hashes to the same bucket as a victim and drive the
      victim into lockout or throttle denial (a remote DoS of a specific peer).
    - **Per-IP cap evasion.** A v6 attacker owns a whole `/64` (2^64 addresses); collisions let
      many real addresses share one bucket (reset/share another's budget) or dodge their own cap.
    - **Cross-family confusion.** Flattening a v6 peer toward a v4-shaped key risks it colliding
      with a real v4 host's bucket.
- **Fix:** the transport pipe was made protocol-agnostic. `pc_ip` (a family tag + 16 address
  bytes, the library's `sockaddr_storage`/lwIP `ip_addr_t` equivalent) is now carried end to
  end: `pc_conn_remote_addr()` / `pc_lwip_to_ip()` produce it, and **every** IP-keyed
  feature stores and matches the **full** address - bucket lookups by `pc_ip_equal` (throttle,
  lockout), allowlist by `pc_ip_prefix_match` (real v4 `/0-32` and v6 `/0-128` CIDR
  containment). The hash/word keys (`pc_ip_key`, `pc_conn_remote_key`, `pc_lwip_ip_key`) and
  the host-order `PC_IPV4` allowlist macro are deleted; the public allowlist entry point is
  now CIDR text (`listener_ip_allow_add_cidr("2001:db8::/32")`). No hashing, no flattening.
- **Prevention:** the native suites now assert the security property directly - distinct v6
  peers get distinct throttle/lockout buckets, a v6 peer never shares a v4 peer's state, and a
  v4 allowlist rule never admits a v6 peer (and vice versa). One owner (the transport) resolves
  the peer address; features consume `pc_ip` and never re-key it.

---

## PreemptQueue example used the pre-3.0 Arduino-ESP32 timer API

- **Status:** FIXED (compiles on esp32:esp32 3.3.10; still builds on the 2.x core the
  PlatformIO CI pins).
- **Found:** 2026-07-02, the all-example compile sweep against the 3.x core (the second
  break it caught, after ESP-NOW).
- **Root cause:** Arduino-ESP32 **3.0** reworked the timer API - `timerBegin(freq)` is now
  frequency-based (was `timerBegin(num, divider, countUp)`), `timerAttachInterrupt()` dropped
  its edge argument, and `timerAlarm()` replaced `timerAlarmWrite()` + `timerAlarmEnable()`.
  The example's ISR setup used the 2.x forms, so it failed to compile under the core an
  Arduino IDE user installs.
- **Fix:** the timer block in `PreemptQueue.ino` is guarded with
  `#if ESP_ARDUINO_VERSION >= ESP_ARDUINO_VERSION_VAL(3, 0, 0)` and uses the 3.x calls on the
  new core, the 2.x calls otherwise. It is the only example using that API (grep-verified).
- **Prevention:** a new **Arduino Build** CI (`.github/workflows/arduino-build.yml`) now
  compiles every example against the Arduino-ESP32 3.x core with arduino-cli - using each
  example's shipped `build_opt.h`, exactly as the IDE builds it - so 3.x / IDF-5 API drift is
  caught on every push, not just in a manual local sweep.

---

## ESP-NOW would not compile on the Arduino-ESP32 3.x core (ESP-IDF 5 recv-callback ABI)

- **Status:** FIXED (compiles clean on esp32:esp32 3.3.10 via arduino-cli; `native_espnow`
  host suite still 7/7).
- **Found:** 2026-07-02, first compile of `EspNow` in the Arduino IDE toolchain
  (esp32 core 3.x). The PlatformIO CI pins `espressif32 @ ^6.0.0` (Arduino-ESP32 **2.x**,
  ESP-IDF 4.4), so it never exercised the 3.x API and reported green - the break only
  showed up under the core an Arduino IDE user actually installs.
- **Root cause:** ESP-IDF 5.0 changed the `esp_now_recv_cb_t` signature. The receive
  callback used the 4.x shape `(const uint8_t *mac, const uint8_t *data, int len)`; under
  IDF 5 the source MAC moved into a struct and the type is now
  `(const esp_now_recv_info_t *info, const uint8_t *data, int len)`, so registering the old
  callback was an invalid conversion (`-fpermissive` error).
- **Fix:** `services/radio/espnow/espnow.cpp` selects the callback signature with an
  `#if ESP_IDF_VERSION >= ESP_IDF_VERSION_VAL(5, 0, 0)` guard (mirrors how `ssh_rsa` handles
  mbedTLS v2/v3) and reads the MAC from `info->src_addr` on 5.x, the `mac` argument on 4.x.
  Both cores now build. The whole binding is under `#ifdef ARDUINO`, so host tests are
  unaffected.
- **Prevention:** all examples now build unmodified in the Arduino IDE (each ships a
  `build_opt.h`) and were compile-swept against the 3.x core; a broad multi-feature 3.x
  compile found no other IDF-5 API breaks.

## DMA frames corrupted (~8%) when the completion was posted to the work queue as a pointer

- **Status:** FIXED (HW-verified on an ESP32 DevKitV1: 2.2M+ frames ingested with zero
  integrity errors under concurrent HTTP stress, no heap growth).
- **Found:** 2026-07-02, first HW stress of the new DMA ingest path (`services/dma`). A
  combined webserver + continuous-DMA rig reported `dma_errors: 8824` out of ~95946 frames
  (~8%) via an HTTP counter - while all 11 host tests passed. Textbook "a small happy-path
  smoke hides the bug; stress on hardware surfaces it."
- **Root cause:** the DMA-complete callback posted the `pc_dma_event` whose `data` is a
  **pointer into the 2-deep ping-pong RX buffer** into the 16-deep preempting work queue.
  `pc_pq_post_from_isr()` calls `portYIELD_FROM_ISR()`, but the simulator drives the
  callback from a **task** context (not a real ISR), where the yield is not an immediate
  context switch - so under load `loop()` ran several more completions before the
  high-priority task drained the queue, the two ping-pong buffers wrapped, and the older
  queued pointers read half-overwritten data. A descriptor consumed by another task must
  own its bytes, not point into a buffer that is reused a transfer or two later.
- **Fix:** the callback now **copies the frame bytes into the queue item** (a self-contained
  message) instead of posting the pointer. Eliminates the dangling reference entirely
  (error rate 8% -> 0%). The example `DmaIngest` uses the same copy pattern, and
  `dma.h` now documents that a deferred (queued) consumer must copy the `len` bytes
  rather than keep the RX pointer. The pointer API itself is unchanged and correct for an
  in-callback consumer (the standard DMA-HAL shape).
- **Tests:** the host suite (`native_dma`) covers the ping-pong flip, byte-exact loopback
  round trip, and fail-closed paths; the deferred-consumer lifetime is a HW-load property,
  now covered by the on-device stress rig.

---

## SSH server could not interoperate with a stock OpenSSH client

- **Status:** FIXED (host-tested + HW-verified on an ESP32 against OpenSSH 9.5: `ssh`, pubkey
  auth, and `ssh -L` port forwarding all work with no client-side algorithm overrides).
- **Found:** 2026-06-30, first live `ssh` against the server once a host key was provisioned.
  A stock `ssh user@board` reset during key exchange; even forcing the KEX through, RSA pubkey
  auth was refused. The earlier "handshake HW-verified" had only ever used a hand-built
  minimal client (the native test) and a tiny forced-algorithm client.
- **Two independent root causes, both fixed:**
    - **The RX ring and the KEXINIT store were smaller than a real client's first flight.** A
      modern OpenSSH KEXINIT (post-quantum + curve KEX names, cert host-key algs, EtM MACs,
      `ext-info-c`) is ~1.5 KB. `SSH_KEXINIT_MAX` was 512, so `ssh_kexinit_parse()` rejected
      the payload outright (`len > SSH_KEXINIT_MAX` -> dispatch returns -1 -> RST), and the
      default 1024-byte `RX_BUF_SIZE` ring could not hold the banner + KEXINIT, resetting the
      handshake at key exchange. Fixed by raising `SSH_KEXINIT_MAX` to 2048 (client I_C; the
      server I_S stays small at `SSH_KEXINIT_S_MAX`) and auto-upsizing `RX_BUF_SIZE` to >= 2048
      when SSH is enabled and the ring was left at its default (same idiom as the streaming-body
      upsize; an explicit `RX_BUF_SIZE` is honored).
    - **No RFC 8308 `ext-info` / `server-sig-algs`.** Without it a modern OpenSSH client will
      not sign an RSA key (`send_pubkey_test: no mutual signature algorithm`) and falls back to
      password. Fixed by advertising `ext-info-s` in the server KEXINIT, detecting the client's
      `ext-info-c`, and sending `SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO` with `server-sig-algs = rsa-sha2-256` as the
      first message after NEWKEYS. An inbound `EXT_INFO` is now accepted (ignored) rather than
      answered with UNIMPLEMENTED.
- **Tests:** `test_ssh_server` gains `test_extinfo_build_advertises_server_sig_algs` and
  `test_large_client_kexinit_accepted`; the full-handshake test now sends `ext-info-c` and
  asserts the server replies with EXT_INFO. (Curve25519 KEX + Ed25519 keys, which would let the
  client use its _preferred_ algorithms instead of falling back to group14/rsa, are tracked
  separately on the roadmap.)

## SSH channel close packed CHANNEL_EOF + CHANNEL_CLOSE into one binary packet

- **Status:** FIXED (host-tested; `test_ssh_server`).
- **Found:** 2026-06-30, while building the SSH port-forwarding (`direct-tcpip`) close path on top
  of the channel layer.
- **Root cause:** `build_close_chan()` (`ssh_channel.cpp`) frames the channel-close sequence as
  ten bytes - `CHANNEL_EOF` (type + recipient, bytes 0..4) immediately followed by
  `CHANNEL_CLOSE` (type + recipient, bytes 5..9) - in one output buffer, and the only emit site
  (the `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE` case in `ssh_server.cpp`) sent the whole buffer through a single
  `ssh_pkt_send()`, i.e. **two SSH messages in one binary packet**. RFC 4253 6 says a binary
  packet carries exactly one message; a strict client (openssh runs `packet_check_eom()` after
  each message handler) sees five trailing bytes after `CHANNEL_EOF` and disconnects with a
  packet-integrity error, so a channel could not be closed cleanly against openssh. It slipped
  earlier HW checks because those exercised the handshake + channel data, not a strict close.
- **Fix:** emit the two halves as two packets - `emit(buf, 5)` then `emit(buf + 5, 5)` - so each
  is framed, encrypted, and sequence-numbered on its own. The builder is unchanged (its 10-byte
  layout is still the contract); the fix is at the emit boundary, with a comment so it is not
  re-bundled. Regression test `test_inbound_close_emits_eof_then_close_separately` asserts the
  dispatcher emits two packets (EOF then CLOSE).

## SonarCloud static-analysis sweep: response-header over-read, crypto zeroization, and friends

- **Status:** FIXED (first SonarCloud C/C++ scan; host-tested).
- **Found:** 2026-06-30, the initial SonarCloud analysis (8 BLOCKER, 7 bug, 7 vulnerability
  findings; the ~2169 "code smell" results are mostly modern-C++ style rules that clash with
  this deliberately terse C++11 / zero-heap embedded style and are not defects).
- **Real issues fixed:**
    - **Dynamic-response header over-read on truncation (`cpp:S3519`,
      `protocore.cpp`).** `append_resp_trailer()` returned `snprintf`'s
      _would-be_ length, which can exceed the header buffer when the trailer (Date + CORS +
      user `_extra_hdr` cookies/headers + Connection) does not fit. The caller then sent
      `(u16_t)hlen` bytes from a fixed `header[RESP_HDR_BUF_SIZE]` - reading past the stack
      buffer. Fixed by clamping `append_resp_trailer()`'s return into `[0, cap-1]` so no send
      path (send / send_empty / redirect / send_template / send_chunked) can ever read past
      the buffer; an over-long header is now sent truncated-but-in-bounds.
    - **Crypto key material not securely zeroed (`cpp:S5798` x5, `services/net/snmp/snmp_crypto.cpp`).**
      The `memset()`s that wipe the localized key, AES round keys, key stream, and CFB feedback
      at function exit can be elided by the optimizer (dead store on a buffer that is never read
      again), leaving secrets on the stack. Replaced with `snmp_wipe()`, a volatile-loop clear
      the compiler cannot remove (same idiom as `ssh_wipe`).
    - **Uninitialized byte fed to the parser if the ring drains mid-read (`cpp:S836` x2,
      `presentation.cpp`, `websocket.cpp`).** The drain loops ignored `pc_conn_read_byte()`'s
      return and fed `byte` to the parser even though a `false` return means nothing was read.
      Now they `break` when the read fails.
    - **`conn_pool[slot_id]` indexed without a bound (`cpp:S3519`).** The public response
      emitters dereferenced `conn_pool[slot_id]` on a caller-supplied id; added a
      `slot_id >= MAX_CONNS` guard at each entry (send / send_empty / redirect / send_template /
      send_chunked).
    - **Misleading constructs:** a `(cond) ? 4 : 4` ternary (`cpp:S3923`, `nats.cpp`) reduced to
      `4`; a `while` that always broke on the first iteration (`cpp:S1751`,
      `http_parser.cpp` Forwarded `proto=`) rewritten as the `if` it actually is; and a
      redundant `if (!app(...)) return len; return len;` (`cpp:S3923`, `webdav.cpp`) simplified
      to `app(...); return len;` (the helper is atomic - it leaves `len` unchanged on no-room).
- **Assessed and intentionally kept (false positives, marked `// NOSONAR` with a reason):**
  `cpp:S5332` "using HTTP is insecure" on `http_client.cpp` (a URL parser in an HTTP **client**
  must accept `http://`; TLS is the caller's choice) and `opcua.cpp` (the OPC UA spec
  transport-profile URI `http://opcfoundation.org/...`, an identifier string that is never
  dereferenced as a URL). The 3 remaining `cpp:S134`/long-switch style notes are correct
  protocol-dispatch switches, left as-is.

## WebSocket / SSE upgrade-alloc-fail detached the pcb but never closed it (leak)

- **Status:** FIXED (during the L7 teardown-ownership refactor; host-tested + HW-soaked).
- **Found:** 2026-06-30, auditing the hand-rolled connection teardown sites while routing
  them through one transport-owned API.
- **When a WebSocket or SSE upgrade had already been promoted but the per-protocol slot
  pool was full (`ws_alloc` / `sse_alloc` returned null), the cleanup path called
  `pc_conn_detach(pcb)` and reset the slot but never closed or aborted the pcb.** The
  `struct tcp_pcb` was left open with no lwIP callbacks attached: a leaked pcb that lingered
  until lwIP's own timeout, with the application slot already freed. Under upgrade churn
  against an exhausted pool this slowly bled pcbs.
- **Fix:** the teardown is now owned by the transport. `pc_conn_abort_slot(slot)` frees the
  TLS context (abrupt), detaches the pcb, resets the slot, and sends a RST; every drop path
  (WS/SSE close + upgrade-fail, `session.cpp` `tls_abort`, SSH/telnet/modbus/opcua) routes
  through it (or `pc_conn_close(slot)` for graceful), so a pcb can no longer be detached
  without also being closed. Verified on hardware (COM3): a WS-pool-exhaustion churn drove
  12 `pc_conn_abort_slot` RSTs with every slot reclaimed and no pcb/slot leak (the device
  kept accepting throughout). Tracked-debt item closed in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

---

## Test-report generator spewed "tail: write error: Broken pipe" into the CI log

- **Status:** FIXED (host-verified against all 1906 test functions; behavior identical).
- **Found:** 2026-06-30, reading the CI Test Report run log: the report was written fine but
  the job output was flooded with dozens of `tail: write error: Broken pipe` lines.
- **`get_test_comment` in `test/run_tests.sh` extracted a test's doc comment with**
  `tail -n "+${fn_line}" "$abs_file" | head -20 | awk '...'`**.** The `awk` exits at the first
  match (`print; exit`) and `head -20` closes its input after 20 lines, so once the reader is
  gone GNU `tail` gets `EPIPE` on its next write and prints `tail: write error: Broken pipe` to
  stderr. The helper runs once per test function (~1900 calls in a full run), so the CI log
  filled with the message. Not a correctness bug (the report still generated), but noise that
  hides real warnings.
- **Fix:** fold the slice + scan into a single `awk -v start="$fn_line"` pass that reads the
  file directly (`NR < start` skips, `NR >= start + 20` exits), so the early `exit` no longer
  closes a pipe and nothing writes into a dead reader. Verified behavior-identical to the old
  pipeline across every `void test_*()` in `test/test_*/` (1906 functions, 0 diffs, 0 stderr).

---

## Host Link frame builder did not NUL-terminate, so callers read uninitialized memory

- **Status:** FIXED (found by the header-shim migration verification; host-tested).
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, running the full native suite on WSL after migrating the source tree
  to the new `shared_primitives/shim.h` include. `native_hostlink` was the lone failure out of
  103 envs.
- **`hostlink_build` (`services/fieldbus/hostlink/hostlink.cpp`) wrote exactly the wire frame
  (`@UU XX <text> FF * CR`) and returned its length, but never wrote a NUL terminator, while the
  sibling ASCII builder `sdi12_build` does (it reserves `n + 1` and writes `buf[n] = '\0'`).**
  NUL-terminating the ASCII frame is the house convention, so a caller (and the test) that treats
  the returned buffer as a C-string reads off the end into uninitialized stack. It stayed latent
  because the stack byte after the frame happened to be zero; the shim migration shifted the
  binary layout and the byte was now garbage, so `TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_STRING` saw
  `@00RD0000001057*\r` followed by junk and the test crashed (SIGHUP/ERRORED).
- **Fix:** make `hostlink_build` consistent with `sdi12_build` - reserve room for the terminator
  (`if (total >= cap) return 0`, wrap-safe: no addition) and write `buf[p] = '\0'` after the
  frame. The return value is still the frame length (not counting the NUL), so callers may treat
  `buf` as either a sized buffer or a C-string. The existing `native_hostlink` tests now pass
  7/7; the overflow test (`char small[8]`) still fails closed.

---

## Two more 32-bit length-wrap bounds bypasses: SNMP BER decoder + HTTP chunked decode

- **Status:** FIXED (follow-up bug-hunt; host-tested, incl. a regression that crashes the
  pre-fix code even on a 64-bit host).
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, a second bug-hunt sweeping the wrap class across the parsers the first
  pass did not cover.
- **The same 32-bit `size_t` wrap as the codec entry below, in two network-facing parsers the
  first pass missed:**
    - **SNMP BER decoder (`ber_read_header`, `services/net/snmp/snmp_ber.cpp`).** A long-form ASN.1
      length is read as a full 4-octet value (up to `0xFFFFFFFF`), then checked with
      `d->pos + length_val > d->len`. On the 32-bit ESP32 an attacker-supplied length of
      `0xFFFFFFFF` makes `d->pos + length_val` wrap to `d->pos - 1` (`< d->len`), so the bound
      is bypassed and a bogus huge length is returned; downstream `ber_read_oid`'s `i < len`
      loop then reads out of bounds. SNMP is an attacker-reachable UDP agent. `ber_skip` had the
      same pattern. Fix: compare against the remaining capacity (`length_val > d->len - d->pos`,
      valid because `d->pos <= d->len` holds after the count-byte check).
    - **HTTP client chunked decode (`http_client_parse_response`, `services/net/http_client/http_client.cpp`).**
      The hex chunk size `csz` is accumulated unbounded from the response, then clamped with
      `if (in + csz > len)`. A malicious / MITM'd server sending an oversized chunk size makes
      `in + csz` wrap below `len`, skipping the clamp and leaving a multi-gigabyte `memmove`. Fix:
      `if (csz > len - in)` (wrap-safe; `in <= len` here).
- The 64-bit host never wrapped on the 4-octet BER case, so it stayed latent; the HTTP
  regression uses a 16-hex-digit size (`0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`) that wraps a 64-bit `size_t` too,
  so it crashes the old code on the host and proves the fix. Tests added to test_snmp_ber and
  test_http_client.
- **Related hardening (same sweep):** audited the rest of the wrap class clean - `opcua`
  (`r_skip`/`ua_r_string` lengths are `int32`, capped at `0x7FFFFFFF`, and all callers guard
  `> 0`), `protobuf` (`PB_WT_LEN` compares in `uint64_t`; varints reject `> 10` bytes), `lwm2m`
  (24-bit length bounded), and `wamp_get_uri` (`body + 1 > out_cap`) are all correctly bounded.

---

## Codec length fields could wrap the bounds check on a 32-bit target

- **Status:** FIXED (multi-agent codebase audit; host-tested).
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, the codec bug-hunt audit of the v4.x protocol codecs.
- **Three text/binary parsers computed `overhead + declared_length` before comparing to the
  buffer length, which wraps on a 32-bit `size_t` (the ESP32 target) for an attacker-controlled
  length field, so the `> len` guard could falsely pass and hand the caller an out-of-bounds
  slice.** Affected: `amqp_parse_frame` (AMQP 0-9-1 32-bit size, `services/iot/amqp/amqp.cpp`),
  `nats_parse` MSG byte count (`services/iot/nats/nats.cpp`), and `resp_parse` `$` bulk length
  (`services/redis_resp.cpp`). The 64-bit host tests never exercised the wrap, so it was latent.
  Fix: in each, compare the declared length against the _remaining capacity_ (`len - overhead`)
  without adding, so no addition can wrap. Added oversized-length rejection tests to
  test_amqp / test_nats / test_redis_resp.
- **Related hardening in the same pass:** `stomp` `content-length` parse now rejects on overflow
  AND a present-but-invalid `content-length` is a malformed frame (previously it silently
  fell back to NUL-delimited body parsing - a request-smuggling-style differential); `parse_len`
  caps at `SIZE_MAX`. `flow_export` IPFIX `finish` now fails closed when the message exceeds the
  16-bit length field instead of truncating it. Tests added/updated accordingly.

---

## client.cpp failed to compile on a server-only Arduino build

- **Status:** FIXED (found while building the interop rig; HW build verified on COM3).
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, bringing up the real-protocol interop harness (test/servers).
- **A server-only Arduino build (no HTTP client / MQTT / WS client) did not compile
  (build break).** `client.cpp` guarded its body with only `#if defined(ARDUINO)` yet
  calls `pc_dns_resolve()`, whose declaration lives behind `PC_ENABLE_DNS_RESOLVER`.
  That flag is force-enabled only by a client transport (`HTTP_CLIENT || MQTT || WS_CLIENT`,
  protocore_config.h), so a build that enabled, e.g., WebSocket + SNMP + CoAP + Modbus but
  no client left the symbol undeclared: `error: 'pc_dns_resolve' was not declared in this
scope`. Host builds were unaffected (the body is already `#if defined(ARDUINO)`), so the
  native suites never caught it. Fix: add `PC_NEED_DET_CLIENT` (set alongside the
  DNS-resolver force-enable) and gate the translation unit on
  `#if defined(ARDUINO) && PC_NEED_DET_CLIENT`, so pc_client compiles exactly when a
  client transport needs it. Verified: a WebSocket+SNMP+CoAP+Modbus rig now builds and
  flashes, and the interop harness drives all four against real peers.

## Standards-conformance audit, batch 2e (LOW/SHOULD closeout)

- **Status:** FIXED (standards-conformance audit; host + HW-verified on COM3)
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, multi-agent conformance audit (the batch-2b "Still OPEN" list).
- **Closes the remaining LOW/SHOULD items so the audit is 100% addressed.**
- **WebSocket handshake accepted a malformed upgrade (LOW, RFC 6455 4.2.1).** The upgrade
  test did not require an `upgrade` token in the `Connection` header, nor that
  `Sec-WebSocket-Key` base64-decode to 16 bytes. Both are now required; a bad handshake
  gets `400` and no upgrade. Tests: `test_web_terminal`
  `test_ws_upgrade_requires_connection_token`, `test_ws_upgrade_rejects_bad_key_length`.
- **MQTT topic validation (LOW, MQTT-3.3.2-2 / 1.5.3).** `mqtt_build_publish` now rejects a
  Topic Name containing wildcards (`+`/`#`); `mqtt_parse_publish` rejects a Topic Name that
  is not well-formed UTF-8 or contains U+0000. The UTF-8 validator was extracted to a shared
  primitive (`shared_primitives/utf8.h`) and reused by WebSocket (no duplicate copy).
  Tests: `test_mqtt` `test_publish_wildcard_topic_rejected`,
  `test_publish_topic_nul_or_bad_utf8_rejected`.
- **base64url decoder was lenient (LOW, RFC 4648 5 / RFC 7515).** `base64url_decode` also
  accepted the standard `+`/`/` alphabet, contradicting its name and the JWS base64url
  contract. Now strict (URL alphabet only); no caller fed it standard base64 (OIDC `n`/`e`
  are Base64urlUInt, not `x5c`). Not a signature-bypass vector (JWS signs the literal
  transmitted ASCII), hence LOW. Test: `test_jwt` `test_base64url_strict_alphabet`.
- **Digest nonce never rotated; no replay window bound (SHOULD, RFC 7616 3.3).** The server
  used a single fixed nonce regenerated only at `begin()`, so a captured Digest response
  could be replayed indefinitely. Replaced with a stateless, keyed, timestamped nonce
  (`<issue_ms_hex>.<SHA-256(secret||issue) truncated>`): no per-nonce table (compatible with
  the shared-nothing worker model), bounded lifetime (`PC_DIGEST_NONCE_LIFETIME_MS`,
  default 5 min), and an expired-but-valid response is answered `401 stale=true` for a
  transparent retry (not counted against the lockout). Full per-nonce `nc` replay tracking
  remains intentionally out of scope: it requires shared mutable per-nonce state the
  deterministic worker model cannot hold safely; the bounded-lifetime nonce is the standard
  stateless mitigation. Tests: `test_digest_auth` `test_nonce_is_stateless_timestamped`,
  `test_stale_nonce_triggers_transparent_retry`.
- **SNMP v2c GET returned noSuchObject for a missing instance (LOW, RFC 3416 4.2.1).** A
  Get for an unbound name always reported `noSuchObject`. Now distinguishes
  `noSuchInstance` (the name's object-type prefix matches a registered object, only the
  instance is absent) from `noSuchObject` (no such object at all). Test: `test_snmp_agent`
  `test_get_bad_instance_v2c_nosuchinstance`.
- **HTTP chunked was sent to HTTP/1.0 clients (MED-niche, RFC 7230 3.3.1).** `send_chunked`
  always emitted `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, which is invalid for a 1.0 client. It now
  falls back to a close-delimited body (no Transfer-Encoding, `Connection: close`, raw bytes
  paged across loops, end signalled by the connection close) when the request is not
  HTTP/1.1. Tests: `test_chunked` `test_http10_falls_back_to_close_delimited`,
  `test_http10_large_body_not_truncated`. HW: `--http1.0 /stream` -> `HTTP/1.0 200` +
  `Connection: close`, body intact; `--http1.1` -> chunked.

## Standards-conformance audit, batch 2d (WebDAV PROPFIND Depth: infinity)

- **Status:** FIXED (standards-conformance audit; HW-verified)
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, multi-agent conformance audit (WebDAV).
- **PROPFIND `Depth: infinity` was silently truncated to one level (MED, RFC 4918
  9.1.1).** A collection PROPFIND with `Depth: infinity` returned a one-level 207 the
  client would read as a complete tree. The server lists at most one level, so it now
  rejects infinity with `403` + the `<D:propfind-finite-depth/>` precondition body;
  `Depth: 0`/`1` are unchanged. HW: `Depth: infinity` -> 403 (precondition body present),
  `Depth: 1` -> 207.

## Standards-conformance audit, batch 2c (HTTP If-None-Match comparison)

- **Status:** FIXED (standards-conformance audit)
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, multi-agent conformance audit (HTTP semantics).
- **If-None-Match used exact strong `strcmp` (MED, RFC 9110 13.1.2).** Conditional GET
  only matched a single, byte-identical strong tag, so it ignored `*`, a comma-separated
  tag list, and the mandated weak comparison (an inbound `W/"x"` for our strong `"x"`).
  A standards-compliant cache revalidating with `W/` tags, a list, or `*` got a full 200
  instead of 304. Fix: `inm_matches()` handles `*` (matches the current representation),
  splits a list, and weak-compares (ignores a `W/` prefix). Test: `test_application`
  `test_serve_static_inm_star_list_weak` (`*` / `W/"x"` / list-with-tag -> 304;
  list-without-tag -> 200).

## Standards-conformance audit, batch 2b (WS UTF-8, SSH padding, syslog PRI, BER OID)

- **Status:** FIXED (standards-conformance audit)
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, multi-agent conformance audit.
- **WebSocket: TEXT messages were not UTF-8-validated (MED, RFC 6455 8.1).** An invalid-
  UTF-8 text message was delivered to the app instead of failing the connection. Fix:
  validate the fully reassembled + decompressed TEXT message and close 1007
  (WS_CLOSE_INVALID_PAYLOAD) on invalid UTF-8 (strict: rejects overlong / surrogate /
  out-of-range / truncated). BINARY frames are not validated. Tests: test_websocket.
- **SSH: padding_length < 4 was not rejected (LOW, RFC 4253 6).** The receive path only
  checked padding < packet length. Now also rejects padding < 4 (gated behind MAC
  verification, so a robustness gap, not a vulnerability).
- **syslog: PRI not range-bounded (LOW, RFC 5424 6.2.1).** An out-of-range caller
  facility/severity could emit a malformed PRI. Now clamped to 0..191.
- **SNMP/BER: OID decoder mishandled a first subidentifier >= 128 (LOW, X.690 8.19.4).**
  The first subidentifier (40*arc0 + arc1) is base-128 and may span octets; the decoder
  read only one octet (encoder was already correct). Fixed; common OIDs (1.3.6.1...,
  first subid 43) decode identically. Test: test_oid_large_first_subidentifier_roundtrip.
- **These LOW/SHOULD items are now CLOSED in batch 2e (above):** HTTP chunked to non-1.1
  clients, SNMP v2c noSuchInstance vs noSuchObject, Digest nonce rotation (stateless
  timestamped nonce; full nc-replay tracking intentionally out of scope), stricter
  base64url, WS handshake Connection:Upgrade + key-length check, MQTT topic UTF-8/wildcard.

## Standards-conformance audit, batch 2a (auth: JWT alg, Digest uri)

- **Status:** FIXED (found by the auth/crypto conformance audit)
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, multi-agent conformance audit (auth module).
- **JWT: the `alg` header was never validated (RFC 7515 5.2, MED).** `jwt_verify_hs256`
  computed HMAC-SHA256 and compared without checking the token's declared algorithm, so
  a token whose header said `none` / `RS256` / `HS384` was accepted as long as its
  signature equaled base64url(HMAC-SHA256(secret, signing_input)) - an algorithm-
  substitution hazard (not directly exploitable since the HMAC is still enforced and
  empty-sig `none` fails the length gate, hence MED). Fix: decode the header and require
  `alg":"HS256"` before verifying. Test: `test_jwt` `test_alg_not_hs256_rejected` (a
  valid-HMAC token with alg `none` is rejected).
- **Digest: the `uri` parameter was not matched to the request target (RFC 7616 3.4,
  MED).** `check_digest_auth` folded the client-supplied `uri` into HA2 but never
  compared it to the actual request target, so a Digest response captured for route A
  was structurally valid against any route under the same realm/nonce. Fix: reconstruct
  the request target (`path[?query]`) and require it equals `uri`. Test:
  `test_digest_auth` `test_uri_mismatch_rejected`.
- Audited clean: Basic auth (first-colon split), OIDC RS256 (strict alg/exp/nbf/iss/aud
    - constant-time RSA block compare), TOTP/HOTP (RFC 4226 truncation), OAuth2 client,
      constant-time HMAC compare. Noted for later (SHOULD/LOW): Digest nonce rotation + `nc`
      replay tracking; stricter base64url; constant-time Digest response compare.

## Standards-conformance audit, batch 1 (WS / MQTT / CoAP / Telnet)

- **Status:** FIXED (found by the parallel standards-conformance audit; specs read from
  the downloaded RFC texts, mapped in docs/STANDARDS.md)
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, multi-agent conformance audit against the live specs.
- Five real conformance gaps, fixed with tests:
    - **WebSocket close left the TCP socket open (HIGH, RFC 6455 5.5.1).** The plaintext
      WS close/error path (protocore.cpp) only freed the WS slot and
      `http_reset`'d it - it never closed the TCP connection (the TLS path did). The slot
      stayed CONN_ACTIVE and re-armed as an HTTP parser, so bytes after the Close frame
      were re-interpreted as a new HTTP request (state confusion). Fix: `pc_conn_begin_close`
      on the slot so it leaves CONN_ACTIVE (the queued Close frame still flushes).
    - **MQTT PUBLISH QoS=3 accepted (HIGH, MQTT-3.3.1-4 / 4.8.0-1).** A PUBLISH with both
      QoS bits set was treated as QoS 2; the spec says it is malformed and the receiver
      MUST close the connection. Fix: `mqtt_parse_publish` rejects qos==3; the handler
      `mq_close()`s on a malformed PUBLISH.
    - **CoAP unsupported method returned 5.01 (MED, RFC 7252 5.8).** Must be 4.05 Method
      Not Allowed. Fixed.
    - **CoAP unrecognized critical option silently ignored (MED, RFC 7252 5.4.1).** An
      unknown odd-numbered (critical) option must yield 4.02 Bad Option (so e.g. Accept,
      or Block when COAP_BLOCK is off, is rejected, not ignored). Fixed.
    - **Telnet literal IAC (0xFF) in output not doubled (MED, RFC 854).** Echoed/printed
      0xFF bytes were sent un-doubled, desyncing the client's command stream. Fix: a
      `send_escaped` data path doubles IAC for echo + app output (protocol commands still
      use the raw path).
    - SNMP/BER, SSH, WebDAV, syslog, OIDC/TOTP/Basic-auth/OAuth2 audited clean.

## CoAP Observe used millis() (would not build on host + pluggable-clock violation)

- **Status:** FIXED (found by the test-gap hardening pass)
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, adding a CI env that compiles the Observe-gated code.
- **Symptom:** `coap_notify()` (under `PC_ENABLE_COAP_OBSERVE`) built the notification
  message-id with `millis()` and pulled `<Arduino.h>` for it. The flag was enabled by no
  test env, so the code had never been compiled on host - it failed to build there
  (`'millis' was not declared`), and even on ESP32 it violated the pluggable-clock rule
  that `pc_millis()` is the single monotonic source (same class as the dns_resolver
  bug above). Latent because the whole Observe path was never compiled in CI.
- **Fix:** use `pc_millis()` (include `services/clock.h`), drop the Arduino.h
  include; added a `native_coap_observe` env so the Observe-gated code is compiled + the
  CoAP suite runs under the flag in CI (no longer bit-rots).

## HTTP request smuggling: Transfer-Encoding ignored on inbound requests

- **Status:** FIXED (found by the test-gap hardening pass)
- **Found:** 2026-06-29, request-parser test-gap review.
- **Symptom:** the HTTP parser only framed request bodies by `Content-Length` and
  ignored `Transfer-Encoding` entirely. A `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` request with no
  `Content-Length` was treated as body-length-0, so the chunk octets
  (`5\r\nhello\r\n0\r\n\r\n`) were left in the RX buffer and re-parsed as the next request
    - a classic TE request-smuggling / desync vector on a keep-alive connection (and the
      CL+TE combination is the canonical CL.TE desync).
- **Fix:** the server does not decode chunked request bodies, so reject any request
  bearing `Transfer-Encoding` -> `PARSE_ERROR` (400), fail-closed, matching the existing
  conflicting-`Content-Length` rejection (RFC 9112 §6.1/§6.3). Tests:
  `test_compliance` `test_transfer_encoding_chunked_rejected` /
  `_with_content_length_rejected` / `_case_insensitive_rejected`.

## Byte-range parser integer overflow on a huge Range value

- **Status:** FIXED (v4.9.1; found by the edge-case audit)
- **Found:** 2026-06-28, agent edge-case test-gap audit.
- **Symptom (latent):** `parse_byte_range` accumulated `start/end = *10 + digit` with no
  overflow guard, so a `Range: bytes=99999999999999999999999-` wraps `size_t` to a small
  value that can pass the `start >= size` check and yield a wrong `206` window.
- **Fix:** saturate the accumulator at `SIZE_MAX` on overflow, so a huge start is treated
  as past-EOF (416) and a huge end clamps to the last byte - never a corrupt window.

## If-Modified-Since month token could mis-parse (off-by-alignment)

- **Status:** FIXED (v4.9.1; in v4.9.0's just-shipped conditional-GET code)
- **Found:** 2026-06-28, agent edge-case test-gap audit.
- **Symptom (latent):** `http_not_modified_since` matched the month via
  `strstr(MONTHS, mon)` without checking the match offset is a multiple of 3, so a
  malformed token like `ebM` (which appears inside "FebMar") parsed as a valid month ->
  a wrong 304/200 cache decision on malformed input. No memory-safety impact.
- **Fix:** reject the match unless `(mp - MONTHS) % 3 == 0`.

## DNS resolver ignored the pluggable clock

- **Status:** FIXED (v4.9.1; found by the duplicate-code audit)
- **Found:** 2026-06-28, agent services duplicate-code audit.
- **Symptom:** `services/dns_resolver` polled its resolve deadline with `millis()` instead
  of `pc_millis()`, so it ignored a custom clock (`pc_set_clock`) - violating the
  pluggable-clock rule that `pc_millis()` is the single monotonic source.
- **Fix:** use `pc_millis()`. (The bigger dedup, pc_client reusing this one resolver,
  shipped later as the shared-primitive DNS-owner change.)

## Client ring used `volatile` indices (weak cross-core ordering)

- **Status:** FIXED (v4.8.1; found by analysis while unifying the ring primitive)
- **Found:** 2026-06-28, merging the server/client ring implementations.
- **Symptom (latent):** the outbound client ring (`pc_client`) used `volatile size_t`
  head/tail. `volatile` blocks compiler reordering but provides no cross-core
  acquire/release; on the dual-core ESP32 (producer = tcpip_thread, consumer = caller
  loop, often different cores) the consumer could observe an advanced `head` before
  the buffer bytes it published were visible -> a rare stale read. The server ring
  already used `pc_atomic` (correct); the client was inconsistent.
- **Fix:** both transports now share `ring.h` (the `pc_atomic` SPSC index +
  the drain math); the client ring's indices are `pc_atomic`, matching the server's
  acquire/release ordering. One ring primitive, no hand-rolled wrap/ordering.

## Client transport could deadlock on a large inbound transfer

- **Status:** FIXED (v4.8.0; same fix as the server, found by analysis during the
  unified-client-transport pass)
- **Found:** 2026-06-28, reviewing `pc_client` against the server's ack-on-consume fix.
- **Symptom (latent):** an outbound client (http_client / mqtt / ws_client) reading a
  response larger than the client ring could stall - the same class as the server
  deadlock below, in the other direction.
- **Root cause:** `pc_client`'s recv callback ACKed on copy (`tcp_recved` in
  `cc_recv`) with a 4 KB ring (< TCP_WND), so a sustained inbound transfer could fill
  the ring, get refused (lwIP `refused_data`), and race.
- **Fix:** ack-on-consume on the client transport too - `cc_recv` no longer ACKs;
  `pc_client_read()` marshals `tcp_recved()` for the bytes it drained. Default
  `PC_CLIENT_RX_BUF` raised 4096 -> 8192 (>= TCP_WND). Client and server transports
  now share one flow-control model.
- **HW proof:** device `http_get()` of a 12 KB body (> the 8 KB client ring, so it
  wraps the ring and exercises the ack-on-consume read path) returned the full
  `len:12000`, 5/5 - no truncation or deadlock.

## RX flow-control deadlock on streamed uploads (WebDAV PUT)

- **Status:** FIXED (v4.6.0; host + HW validated)
- **Found:** 2026-06-28, stress-testing WebDAV streaming PUT on hardware.
- **Symptom:** large PUTs intermittently hung ~20 s (curl timeout), stored 0 bytes,
  and repeated hangs eventually wedged every slot (device pings but HTTP is dead).
- **Root cause:** `recv_cb` ACKed received data on **copy** (`tcp_recved` at copy
  time), decoupling the advertised TCP window from how full the ring actually was.
  A slow consumer (flash writes) let the ring fill to `RX_BUF_SIZE`; the next
  segment was refused (`ERR_MEM` -> lwIP `refused_data`). When `RX_BUF_SIZE <
TCP_WND` the ring can never hold a full receive window, so refusals were constant
  and lwIP's refused-data redelivery raced fatally. Serial trace nailed it: failing
  PUTs stalled at exactly `bytes_written == RX_BUF_SIZE`. This was an **interlayer**
  bug: the receive-window invariant was smeared across transport (ACK on copy),
  presentation (drains the ring) and session (worker loop), with no single owner.
- **Fix:** ack-on-consume, owned entirely by transport. `recv_cb` no longer ACKs;
  the worker calls `pc_conn_ack_consumed(slot)` once per loop and transport
  reopens the window by exactly the bytes drained since the last ACK
  (`tcp_recved` marshaled to tcpip_thread). The window now tracks ring occupancy,
  so a slow sink cannot overflow the ring. **TCP-level requirement:** the ring must
  hold at least one receive window (`RX_BUF_SIZE >= TCP_WND`); a smaller ring is a
  configuration error (you cannot advertise a window larger than your buffer).
- **HW proof:** RX=8192 (>= TCP_WND) + ack-on-consume -> 10/10 50 KB byte-exact,
  `backpressure=0`. Pre-fix: RX=2048 -> ~40% hang + permanent wedge.

## Boot stack-overflow when RX_BUF_SIZE is large (pool_init)

- **Status:** FIXED (v4.6.0; host validated)
- **Found:** 2026-06-28, while testing large rings for the deadlock above.
- **Symptom:** "Stack canary watchpoint triggered (loopTask)" at boot
  (`begin()` -> `pool_init` -> `memset`) once `RX_BUF_SIZE` was set large (e.g. 8192).
- **Root cause:** `conn_pool[i] = {}` materializes a full `sizeof(TcpConn)`
  temporary - the entire `rx_buffer[RX_BUF_SIZE]` - on the loopTask stack.
- **Fix:** reset from a single `static const TcpConn blank = {}` in BSS via
  copy-assign (uses `pc_atomic::operator=`, no atomic-memset UB); no large stack
  temporary.

## WebDAV streamed PUT leaks the file handle on abort

- **Status:** FIXED (v4.6.0)
- **Found:** 2026-06-28, investigating the deadlock cascade to a permanent wedge.
- **Symptom:** a PUT torn down before completion (peer reset / timeout / the
  deadlock above) never closed `g_dav_put_file`; after a few, LittleFS ran out of
  open-file slots and `open()` failed ("no permits for creation").
- **Root cause:** the file was closed only on the PARSE_COMPLETE handler path; no
  cleanup hook for an aborted stream.
- **Fix:** added `HttpStreamAbortCb` to the parser stream hooks, fired from
  `http_parser_reset` when `body_streaming && parse_state != PARSE_COMPLETE`.
  WebDAV registers it and closes the half-written file. The completion path now
  also clears `g_dav_put_active` so the abort hook cannot double-close.

## WebDAV concurrent streamed PUTs clobber each other

- **Status:** FIXED (v4.7.0; host + HW validated)
- **Found:** 2026-06-28, concurrent (4x) 50 KB PUT stress test.
- **Symptom:** 4 simultaneous PUTs -> one 201, the rest 409/timeout (the file was
  not actually written for the losers).
- **Root cause:** the WebDAV streaming-PUT state (`g_dav_put_file/active/error/...`)
  was a single global, and `HttpStreamDataCb` carried no slot/connection, so the
  data hook could not route bytes to per-connection state. Overlapping PUTs shared
  and clobbered the one global transfer.
- **Fix:** made the streaming-body `data` hook slot-aware (`HttpStreamDataCb(HttpReq*,
...)`; `begin`/`abort` already had it) and replaced the global state with per-slot
  `g_dav_put[MAX_CONNS]`, so each connection streams to its own file. Aligns with the
  no-spaghetti directive (the data hook lacking connection context was the interlayer
  gap). HW: 4 concurrent PUTs with distinct payloads, all 4 byte-exact (was 0/4).

## TX truncation on large responses (serve_file, send_chunked)

- **Status:** SHIPPED (serve_file v4.4.1; send_chunked v4.5.0)
- **Found:** 2026-06-28, stress-testing file/chunked GET on hardware.
- **Symptom:** any file/WebDAV GET or chunked/SSE body larger than ~`TCP_SND_BUF`
  (~5.7 KB) was truncated.
- **Root cause:** the senders called `pc_conn_send()` and ignored the return; once
  the TCP send buffer filled, the remainder was silently dropped. Hidden on host
  because the mock `tcp_sndbuf` is constant and `tcp_write` never returns `ERR_MEM`.
- **Fix:** per-slot send continuations (`file_send_pump` / `chunk_send_pump`) that
  page out one send-window per worker loop and resume on the sent callback; the
  chunked API became a pull generator (`ChunkSource`) so it can resume across loops.
