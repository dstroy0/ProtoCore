"""Inventory which radio blob functions are IRAM-resident, and are therefore ISR-reachable.

A function reached from an interrupt cannot live in flash: the cache is disabled during a flash
write and while the SPI flash is otherwise busy, so a flash-resident handler faults there. The
radio blobs place every such routine in an IRAM section, which is why they carry a `ram_` prefix
and why the PHY dispatch table points into IRAM rather than flash.

That placement is a constraint on any replacement rather than an implementation detail: a function
listed here has to be IRAM-resident in our own driver too, or it fails only during flash activity,
which is the hardest failure to reproduce.

The same placement is why the radio pins to one core: the ISRs are registered on the core that
brings WiFi up, and the tables they dispatch through are shared per-core state.

Reads section placement from the symbol table; no code is disassembled.
