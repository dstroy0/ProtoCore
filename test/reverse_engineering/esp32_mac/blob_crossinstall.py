"""Compare the radio blobs' symbols between the two installs that ship them.

The Arduino framework and ESP-IDF each carry their own copy of the radio libraries, built at
different times from different sources. If the exported and imported names are the same set in
both, then the entry points are fixed by the ecosystem and any analysis of one install transfers
to the other, with only addresses, sizes and code layout differing. If they are not, then anything
read out of one install is version-specific and has to be regenerated per SDK.

This compares per library, on the targets both installs carry, and reports name differences in
both directions alongside the size difference that shows they are genuinely separate builds.

Symbol tables only: this reads names, not code.

Usage:  python -m test.reverse_engineering.esp32_mac.blob_crossinstall
