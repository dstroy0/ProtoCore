"""Classify what actually changed in each radio blob function that differs between the installs.

Knowing that 768 functions differ says nothing about whether any of them behave differently. Two
builds of the same routine can disagree because the scheduler moved instructions around, which is
how a compiler expresses RF timing, or because the code now writes a different register with a
different value, which is a behavior change.

Each differing function is put in one bucket, checked in this order:

  reordered    the same instructions in a different order, and every immediate, call target and
               register reference is the same multiset. Timing, not behavior
  values       the same instruction shapes and the same registers, with different immediates.
               A tuning constant moved: transmit power, a gain step, a threshold
  calls        the set of symbols the function reaches changed
  registers    the set of peripheral registers it touches changed
  structural   instructions were added or removed beyond the above

Reads the instruction streams `blob_diff.py` extracts, so the two agree by construction.

Usage:  python -m test.reverse_engineering.esp32_mac.blob_behavior [--lib libphy.a] [--chip esp32]
