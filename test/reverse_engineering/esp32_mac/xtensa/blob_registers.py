"""Group the Espressif radio blobs' register accesses by the function that makes them.

The blobs ship with -ffunction-sections and an intact symbol table, so each function's code and
its literal pool sit in their own section and carry the vendor's own name. Xtensa reaches an
absolute address through `l32r`, which loads a 32-bit word out of that pool, so a peripheral
register appears as a literal and every access to it is that literal plus a displacement.

This walks the disassembly keeping a value per address register: `l32r` puts a literal into one,
and a later load or store through it names a register and a width. What comes out is, per
function, the ordered list of registers it touches and the calls it makes between them.

Nothing is decompiled: this reads the instruction stream objdump prints.

**XTENSA ONLY.** The extraction is built on `l32r` reading a literal pool, which is how xtensa
reaches a 32-bit constant. The RISC-V dies (C2, C3, C5, C6, C61, H2) have no literal pool: they
build an address from a `lui` / `addi` pair whose value comes from a relocation, and they call
through `auipc` / `jalr` rather than a table. Pointed at one of those this would find nothing and
report it as "touches no registers", which is a false negative rather than a result, so it
refuses instead. A RISC-V port is a separate extraction, not a flag.
