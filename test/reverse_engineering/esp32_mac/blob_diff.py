"""Compare the radio blobs' CODE between the two installs that ship them, function by function.

Matching symbol names prove only that an API surface is the same shape. This compares what the
functions actually do, by disassembling every function in both installs and diffing the
instruction streams.

Three verdicts per function, in decreasing strength:

  identical    the encoded bytes and the relocation targets are the same, so the two builds
               emitted the same machine code
  equivalent   the mnemonics, operands and relocation targets match once addresses are masked.
               Code that moved to a different offset lands here: a branch displacement or a
               literal-pool reference is written differently while the instruction is the same
  different    the instruction streams disagree, so the two builds do not do the same thing

Addresses are masked rather than compared because the whole point is that placement moves.
Relocation targets are NOT masked: which symbol a call reaches is functional.
