"""Cross-reference the Espressif radio blobs across every ESP variant the SDK ships.

A driver that replaces the vendor radio has to work on more than one die, so the first question is
which entry points every variant has in common and which are one part's alone. This reads each
variant's blobs with that variant's own objdump - the C-series parts are RISC-V, not xtensa, so one
toolchain does not cover them - and reports the parity.

Symbol tables only: this reads names, not code.

Usage:  python -m test.reverse_engineering.esp32_mac.blob_parity
