// On-device CCOUNT microbenchmark for services/i2c - EXCEPT there is nothing pure to benchmark here,
// so this sketch deliberately benches nothing and exists only to keep services/i2c under the same
// performance_benching/device/<service>/ umbrella and to prove the header still compiles and links.
//
// Why nothing is benched: services/peripherals/i2c.h is a single header whose entire public surface is one inline
// function, pc_i2c_begin(), which is a direct pass-through to Wire.begin(PC_I2C_SDA_PIN,
// PC_I2C_SCL_PIN) - it brings up the shared I2C bus for the peripheral drivers (RTC, SHT3x, MPR121,
// ADS1115, INA219, PCA9685). There is no CPU-side codec, no encode/decode/parse/checksum/CRC, no
// config-word build, no conversion math - nothing separable from the real hardware bus. Calling
// pc_i2c_begin() would perform an actual I2C bring-up on GPIO 21/22, which is exactly the kind of real
// hardware I/O this rig (no peripherals attached) must never do. Unlike performance_benching/device/ads1115 - where the
// I2C transaction is stubbed but a deterministic config-word/conversion codec remains to bench - i2c.h
// has no such codec to isolate, so the honest result is an empty benchmark. We still #include the header
// and take (never call) the address of pc_i2c_begin() so the compiler/linker prove the real production
// symbol is valid in this context.
//
// Build/flash (JTAG-capable S3 over its USB-Serial/JTAG port):
//   idf.py -C test/performance_benching/i2c -t upload --upload-port COM7
// then open the port to capture the repeating "DB ..." lines (each run repeats every ~5 s, so a capture
// opened at any time still catches a full cycle).
