gen_test_envs.py - generate the native [env:*] blocks in platformio.ini from the
single source of truth, test/test_matrix.json.

Why: the native test envs used to be ~63 hand-written, near-duplicate blocks (each
re-listing the same -std/-I flags, its src filter, and its test filter), and the
runner only invoked a handful - so most per-feature suites silently fell out of the
report. Now there is ONE table; this script regenerates the env blocks from it, and
run_tests.sh auto-discovers every generated env. Edit the table, not the ini.

Each entry keeps strict per-feature isolation (its own flags + src + test dirs), so
"this feature compiles and tests on its own" stays guaranteed.

Usage:
    python3 test/gen_test_envs.py            # rewrite platformio.ini in place
    python3 test/gen_test_envs.py --check    # exit 1 if the ini is out of date (CI)

The table schema (test/test_matrix.json), per env:
    "native_x": {
        "desc":  "free text -> emitted as ; comments above the env",
        "base":  "native_base" (default) | "env:native_stack_l46" | "env:native_stack_http",
        "flags": ["-DPROTOCORE_ENABLE_X=1", ...],     # extras beyond the base flags
        "src":   ["+<services/x/x.cpp>", "-<*>"], # build_src_filter lines, verbatim
        "tests": ["test_x", ...],                 # test_filter entries; [] means run no suite
        "test_build_src": "no",                   # optional override
        "extra_scripts": ["pre:test/x.py", ...]   # optional PlatformIO build hooks
