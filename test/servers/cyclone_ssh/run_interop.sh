#!/usr/bin/env bash
# SSH-2 real-peer interop: the Oryx CycloneSSH client (a from-scratch second SSH stack) drives an SSH
# server through a full KEX + user auth + an encrypted-channel exchange. Two modes:
#
#   (default) self-test against a throwaway localhost OpenSSH sshd - proves the CycloneSSH client is
#             functional (public-key AND password auth). Self-contained + reproducible.
#
#   (rig)     CYCLONE_SSH_RIG_HOST=<ip> [CYCLONE_SSH_RIG_USER=admin CYCLONE_SSH_RIG_PASS=s3cret]
#             drive OUR SSH server on a device rig. Our server echoes channel DATA, so the client runs
#             in --echo mode (write a token, read it back). This is the real CycloneSSH<->pc interop;
#             it is HW-verified on an ESP32-P4 (see README).
#
# This is the SSH counterpart to test/servers/cyclone_dtls (CycloneSSL DTLS 1.3). The bug it exposed -
# server-preference algorithm negotiation, a RFC 4253 §7.1 violation - is fixed (see docs/BUGS.md).
#
# Linux only (POSIX sockets + native gcc). Needs openssh-server + ssh-keygen for the self-test.
