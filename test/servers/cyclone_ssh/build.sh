# Clones Oryx Embedded's Common / CycloneCRYPTO / CycloneSSH on first run (GPLv2, into .work/, never
# vendored here), then compiles the whole CycloneSSH ssh/ engine + shell client + all of CycloneCRYPTO
# (minus hardware/ and ocsp/, which need CycloneTCP) + the Common ports + the POSIX socket shim
# (socket.c / shim/core/net.h, which stands in for CycloneTCP so no TCP/IP stack is linked), and links
# the client. Cyclone bodies are wrapped in #if (X_SUPPORT == ENABLED), so a lean config leaves the
# unused ones as empty translation units.
