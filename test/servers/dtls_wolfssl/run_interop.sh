# DTLS 1.3 real-peer interop: drive the library's dtls_conn server with wolfSSL's DTLS 1.3 client.
# Builds wolfSSL (with DTLS 1.3) on first run, generates a throwaway Ed25519 certificate, compiles
# the harness (test/servers/dtls_wolfssl/dtls_interop_server.cpp) against the library sources, then
# runs a full handshake + application-data round trip. Prints "INTEROP OK" on success.
#
# Linux only (needs a POSIX UDP socket + a native g++). Tested on Debian/aarch64 (Raspberry Pi).
#
#   usage: test/servers/dtls_wolfssl/run_interop.sh
