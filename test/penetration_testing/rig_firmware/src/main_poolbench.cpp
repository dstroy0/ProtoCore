// On-device CCOUNT microbenchmark for the memory manager (server/mmgr): the two pools, their
// ownership test, and what the secure pool's wipe-on-release actually costs. Prints "PB <op> ..."
// lines over USB-CDC, the same shape as the crypto bench.
//
// Three claims were made while building the pools, all of the kind that sound obviously true and are
// worth nothing until a cycle counter says so:
//
//   1. borrowing from a pool is cheap - it is a bump allocation behind an accessor
//   2. ownership testing is "virtually free": the slot count and slot size are compile-time, so it is
//      one unsigned subtract and compare with no bookkeeping and no loop
//   3. wipe-on-release is the ONLY real cost difference between the two pools, and it is linear in
//      the bytes reclaimed
//
// Claim 3 is the one that matters for the design: the two pools are the same mechanism, so releasing
// the same byte count from each isolates the wipe exactly.
//
// This lives in the rig firmware rather than examples/ because the pools are private - their state
// has internal linkage and the accessor headers are not reachable from a user sketch. A shipped
// example calling them would hand every user the capability the design exists to withhold.
