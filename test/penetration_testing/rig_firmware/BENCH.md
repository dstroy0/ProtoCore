# On-device benchmarks (CCOUNT)

How to build, flash, capture and read the microbenchmarks that live in `src/main_*bench.cpp`.

Everything here is measured on the die, with the Xtensa/RISC-V cycle counter, because this project's
record at predicting performance from first principles is poor. A number in `docs/FEATURE_PERFORMANCE.md`
that did not come from one of these runs is marked as conjecture, not measurement.

## Why CCOUNT and not micros()

`ESP.getCycleCount()` reads CCOUNT, which ticks at the CPU clock. It is exact to the cycle, has no
timer-interrupt jitter, and is frequency-independent as a raw count - which matters because the dies
differ (S3 240 MHz, P4 360 MHz). Every bench reads `getCpuFrequencyMhz()` at startup and derives ns
from the live frequency; **a hardcoded 240 inflates every P4 figure by 1.5x.**

## The benches

| bench      | source                     | what it answers                                                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| crypto     | `src/main_cryptobench.cpp` | cycles/op for every primitive the library implements itself                                  |
| formatting | `src/main_fmtbench.cpp`    | `snprintf` vs `protocore_sb` vs `protocore_frame_build` - the number behind SRCBANNED ban 20 |

## Build and flash

Two toolchains reach these boards; use whichever matches the die.

**PlatformIO (S3, Arduino-ESP32 2.x):**

```
cd penetration_testing/rig_firmware
pio run -e rig_s3_fmtbench -t upload --upload-port COM4
```

**arduino-cli (C6 / P4, which need Arduino-ESP32 3.x):** see `p4/build_p4_cryptobench.sh` for the
pattern - build in WSL on ext4, flash from Windows with `esptool`.

### Board identity is not the port number

Ports move between sessions. Identify the board, then pick its settings:

```
python -m esptool --port COM4 flash-id      # prints chip type and MAC
```

- MAC `...:73:1c` - S3 DevKitC-1, **OCTAL** PSRAM -> `PSRAM=opi`
- MAC `...:7a:b8` - S3 DevKitC-1 (GPS rig), **OCTAL** PSRAM -> `PSRAM=opi`
- the quad-PSRAM S3 -> `PSRAM=enabled`; giving it `opi` bricks its boot

Getting this backwards prints `E (189) quad_psram: PSRAM chip is not connected, or wrong PSRAM line
mode` and the app never starts.

On Windows, `esptool` lives in the CPython 3.14 install, not the PlatformIO venv:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python314\python.exe -m esptool ...
```

## Capture

The benches print one-shot `CB ` lines over USB-CDC and then delete their task, so the capture has to
be running before the reset that starts them.

On the S3's native USB-Serial/JTAG port: **open with RTS de-asserted** (asserting RTS wedges the JTAG
side) and **DTR asserted**, then pulse RTS once to reset and re-run the bench under capture. A flash
hard-reset re-enumerates the CDC device and invalidates an already-open handle, so wait for
re-enumeration before opening.

```
python -m serial.tools.miniterm COM4 115200 --rts 0 --dtr 1
```

## Reading the output

```
CB CHECK resp frame            identical
CB --- frames ---
CB resp/snprintf               cyc=4212      ns=17550
CB resp/protocore_frame               cyc=1461      ns=6088
```

- `CHECK` lines run first and prove each variant produces **byte-identical output** to the `snprintf`
  it is being compared against. A bench that measures the wrong output is worthless, so a
  `*** DIFFERS ***` line invalidates every number under it - fix that before reading further.
- `cyc` is average cycles per call over N iterations, after a warm call that faults in the code path
  and any libc tables.
- Every result is folded into a `volatile` sink. Without that the optimizer deletes the call whose
  result nobody reads and the variant looks free.

## Adding a bench

1. `src/main_<name>bench.cpp` with a `BENCH(label, N, expr)` loop and a volatile sink.
2. Prove correctness first: a `CHECK` pair per variant, byte-compared against the thing it replaces.
3. Add `[env:rig_s3_<name>bench]` to `platformio.ini` extending `env:rig_s3`, with
   `build_src_filter = +<main_<name>bench.cpp>`.
4. Land the numbers in `docs/FEATURE_PERFORMANCE.md`, and say which die and clock they came from.

## Interpreting a result honestly

A microbenchmark measures a hot loop with everything in cache. It is the right tool for "is this
primitive cheaper than that primitive" and the wrong tool for "how much faster is the server". Where
a figure is used to justify a rule, say what it measured: `docs/SRCBANNED.md` ban 20 claims a ratio,
and the claim is only as good as the row in `FEATURE_PERFORMANCE.md` it points at.
