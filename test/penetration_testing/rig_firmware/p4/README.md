# ESP32-P4 HTTPS rig (arduino-cli)

The wired-Ethernet twin of the `rig_s3_tls` firmware, for the **Waveshare ESP32-P4-POE-ETH**. It exists to
measure the TLS handshake on a board with a **hardware ECC accelerator** (P-256 via mbedTLS `ecc_alt`) and
compare it to the software-curve S3 — see `docs/FEATURE_PERFORMANCE.md`, "Device-CPU breakdown + the
ESP32-P4 (HW ECC)".

The P4 is not an S3, so it does not use the `penetration_testing/rig_firmware` PlatformIO envs (those pin the S3
arduino-2.x core). It builds with **arduino-cli + the arduino-esp32 3.x core** (`esp32:esp32`), and — having
no radio — brings up the **wired PHY** (`Physical.eth->init`) instead of WiFi.

## What it exposes

Identical to `rig_s3_tls`: HTTP/80 (`/`, `/health`, `/status`, `/diag`) + **HTTPS/443** with the same
self-signed ECDSA-P256 test cert, and `GET /bench/tls` — the CCOUNT decomposition of the handshake ECC
(ECDHE gen/shared for x25519 / P-256 / P-521 + one ECDSA-P256 sign, `us/op` at the reported `cpu_mhz`).
Built with `PROTOCORE_TLS_HS_BENCH`, so it also prints `TLSHSBENCH cpu_us=.. wall_us=..` per handshake.

## Build + flash

```sh
# In WSL (arduino-cli with the esp32:esp32 3.x core installed). Builds on ext4, prints the flash command.
REPO=/path/to/ProtoCore ./build_p4_tls.sh

# Flash from Windows (WSL cannot reach the COM port). esptool >= 5.x for esp32p4 support; COM9 = the P4.
esptool --chip esp32p4 --port COM9 --baud 921600 write-flash -z \
  0x2000 P4TlsRig.ino.bootloader.bin 0x8000 P4TlsRig.ino.partitions.bin \
  0xe000 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 P4TlsRig.ino.bin
```

Read `RIG_IP=` from the P4's serial (COM9), then drive it with `performance_benching/tls/tls_hs_time.py <ip>` (client
wall-clock + `/bench/tls`). Note the CH343 auto-reset: to boot the app after flashing, keep DTR deasserted
and pulse only RTS (asserting DTR pulls IO0 low and drops the P4 into the ROM downloader).
