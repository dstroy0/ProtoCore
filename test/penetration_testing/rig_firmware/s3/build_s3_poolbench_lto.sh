# Build the pool bench WITH -flto, to measure cross-TU inlining of the accessor layer.
#
# The accessor's hot ops (protocore_plaintext_span, protocore_plaintext_mark, protocore_plaintext_release) must stay in scratch.cpp:
# they touch anonymous-namespace state, and that TU encapsulation is what makes the pool private.
# LTO is how they get inlined anyway - the optimizer sees across TUs while the source keeps its
# boundaries.
#
# The LINK step needs -flto too. A first attempt passed it only to the compiles and added
# -ffat-lto-objects, so every object carried both IR and ordinary code, the link silently used the
# ordinary code, and the run came back byte-identical to the non-LTO build. Fat objects are what made
# that fail QUIETLY instead of erroring - so: no fat objects, and the flag on the link.
#
# -ffunction-sections/-fdata-sections + --gc-sections stay on; LTO must not cost the reclamation of
# unused pool storage, which pool_gc_check.sh verifies separately.
