// Does a namespace struct cost anything in C? Built twice from this one file (see
// ../build_s3_nsabi.sh): PROTOCORE_NS_FORM=0 calls three of twenty-four leaves by name, PROTOCORE_NS_FORM=1 calls
// the same three through Network.auth.login / Network.tls.handshake / Server.signaling.peek, each
// group's opaque context a member of its own namespace struct.
//
// Freestanding link against the xtensa target toolchain, so what is measured is the C ABI and the
// linker: no framework, no C++ mangling. The numbers that decide it are .text size and how many of
// the twenty-four leaves survive --gc-sections, since a const initializer naming all of them is a
// reference to all of them.
