// Does a namespace struct cost anything? Built twice from one source (see ../build_s3_nsbench.sh):
// PROTOCORE_NS_FORM=0 calls three of twenty-four leaves by name, PROTOCORE_NS_FORM=1 calls the same three through
// Network.auth.login / Network.tls.handshake / Server.signaling.peek, with each group's opaque
// context carried as a member of its own namespace struct.
//
// The number that decides it is flash: the linker strips a leaf nothing references, and a const
// initializer naming all twenty-four is a reference to all twenty-four. If both images are the same
// size the table is free; if the second is larger by the twenty-one unused leaves plus the pointers,
// it is not.
