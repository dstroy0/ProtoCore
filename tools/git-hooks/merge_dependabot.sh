# Strictly best-effort and non-blocking. It does nothing (and never fails the caller) when:
#   - gh is not installed or not authenticated (offline / no credentials),
#   - HEAD is detached, or a rebase / merge / cherry-pick / bisect is in progress,
#   - the current branch is not the base branch of any open Dependabot PR.
# Each candidate PR is merged only if GitHub reports it MERGEABLE and it targets the current branch;
# a merge that does not apply cleanly is aborted, leaving the working tree untouched. The operation
# is idempotent: a PR already contained in the branch merges as an "Already up to date" no-op, so
# repeated commits do not pile up duplicate merge commits.
