"""Group the sidebar into sections instead of 45 pages in encounter order.

Two problems in the tree as generated:

1. Seven roots were duplicates - docs/sphinx/{architecture,languages,osi-model,tcp-ip,
   src-law,symbols,index} are Sphinx sources for a DIFFERENT site, and Doxygen was reading
   them as pages. They shadow the real docs/ pages under lowercase names ("architecture",
   "symbols", a second "ProtoCore"). Excluded rather than grouped: they should never have
   been input.

2. The rest sat in whatever order Doxygen met them, so "Bug log" came third and "Examples"
   ninth. Now five hub pages claim them with @subpage, which is what gives the tree its
   sections and its order - @subpage order is the order they appear.

The grouping answers the question a reader actually arrives with: I am new / I need a fact /
I want to know how it works / is it correct and safe / where is this going.
