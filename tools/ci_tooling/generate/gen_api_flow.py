"""Generate the core-API request-lifecycle flowchart from the source.

The variable parts are read straight from the code so the picture cannot drift:

  - the public `PC` API methods, from src/protocore.h
    (access-specifier aware), bucketed into Register / Configure / Run / Respond;
  - the built-in application protocols, from the session registry
    src/server/proto_builtins.c (each `register_if(PROTO_x, ...)`);
  - the Layer-6 modules present on disk, from src/network_drivers/presentation/.

Those are placed into the fixed OSI request-lifecycle skeleton (transport L4 -> session L5
dispatch seam -> presentation L6 -> application L7 route dispatch -> response back out the
transport), which is the library's architecture (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). The diagram is injected
into the README "Overview" between generated markers.

Run from the repo root:
    python -m tools.ci_tooling.generate.gen_api_flow            # rewrite the README block
    python -m tools.ci_tooling.generate.gen_api_flow --check    # CI: exit 1 if stale
