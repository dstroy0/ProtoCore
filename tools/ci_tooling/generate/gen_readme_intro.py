"""Generate the root README.md intro blocks that must not be hand-maintained.

Not to be confused with gen_readme_sections.py, which owns **docs/README.md**
(the docs landing page). This one owns the **root README.md**, and only two
regions of it:

  QUICK START     the minimal server, copied verbatim from a real sketch
  PROJECT STATUS  measured verification state, from committed artifacts

Why these two are generated:

QUICK START used to not exist at all - the README had zero lines of code, so a
reader could not see the API without leaving the page. Writing one by hand would
have created a second copy of the API to keep in step, and the example READMEs
already show what happens to hand-copied code (see docs/BUGS.md: 86 of them
drifted onto a banned API and 62 onto an enum form that no longer compiles). So
the block is copied from examples/Foundation/Basic/Basic.ino, which CI compiles
as a whole file. If the API changes, the sketch stops compiling and the README
follows in the same commit.

PROJECT STATUS replaces prose that claimed coverage "is lacking" while the
committed coverage report said 99.0% line / 96.1% branch. A progress claim
written by hand is wrong the week after it is written, in either direction.

Usage:  python -m tools.ci_tooling.generate.gen_readme_intro [--check]
