"""Generate the build-flag dependency flowchart from the config header's own guards.

The single source of truth is src/protocore_config.h. A child feature that cannot compile
without a parent is enforced there by a preprocessor guard whose #error says "... requires ...":

    #if PROTOCORE_ENABLE_CHILD && !PROTOCORE_ENABLE_PARENT
    #error "... PROTOCORE_ENABLE_CHILD requires PROTOCORE_ENABLE_PARENT"
    #endif

and a PSRAM-class feature by a guard whose #error mentions PSRAM:

    #if PROTOCORE_ENABLE_HTTP2 && defined(ARDUINO) && !PROTOCORE_H2_POOL_IN_PSRAM
    #error "... PROTOCORE_ENABLE_HTTP2 needs PSRAM ..."
    #endif

This script walks the header with a preprocessor-condition stack. For each #error it reads the
active conditions - the positive PROTOCORE_ENABLE_* term is the feature being built (the child), each
negated PROTOCORE_* term a prerequisite - AND the error message: a "requires" message yields a hard
feature edge, a "PSRAM" message a resource gate, anything else (a worker-stack floor, a size range)
is ignored. Gating on the message is what keeps a scoping clause like `!PROTOCORE_ENABLE_SSH` in a
stack-size guard from being mistaken for "OIDC requires SSH". Auto-derived flags (a `#define
PROTOCORE_ENABLE_X 1` guarded by an OR of other ENABLE flags) are read too. The graph is injected into
the "Build-flag dependencies" section of README.md between generated markers, so it can never drift
from the guards the compiler actually enforces.

Run from the repo root:
    python -m tools.ci_tooling.generate.gen_flag_deps            # rewrite the README block
    python -m tools.ci_tooling.generate.gen_flag_deps --check    # CI: exit 1 if stale
