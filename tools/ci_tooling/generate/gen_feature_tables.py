"""Generate the README feature/codec tables from docs/FEATURES.md.

docs/FEATURES.md is the single source of truth: every feature is a `## Name`
heading, an optional `` `PROTOCORE_ENABLE_*` `` flag line, and a description
paragraph. This script parses those entries, splits them into a FEATURES table
and a CODECS table, and writes both (as HTML tables with a merged header) into
the marked region of README.md and docs/README.md. The hover tooltip is the
feature's description; the link target is the FEATURES.md anchor.

Run from the repo root:
    python -m tools.ci_tooling.generate.gen_feature_tables            # rewrite the tables
    python -m tools.ci_tooling.generate.gen_feature_tables --check    # CI: fail if stale

Keeping the tables generated means they can never drift from FEATURES.md (a
hand-maintained grid silently lost 28 of 106 features before this existed).

    short last row is padded with empty cells so all five columns line up instead of the
