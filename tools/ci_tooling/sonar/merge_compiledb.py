"""Merge per-environment compile_commands.json fragments into one, deduped by file.

PlatformIO writes compile_commands.json to the project root one env at a time, and
no single env enables all of the ~111 PROTOCORE_ENABLE_* features, so a feature-gated
source file is only compiled in the env that turns its flag on. To give the
SonarQube C/C++ analyzer a command for *every* file, gen_compiledb.sh runs
`pio run -t compiledb` for each native env, stashes each result, and this script
merges them: the first env that compiled a given file wins (one command per file).

Two modes, keyed off --baseline:

  * FULL (no --baseline): start empty, merge all fragments -> the whole database.
  * AFFECTED (--baseline test/compile_commands.json): start from the committed
    baseline and OVERLAY only the fragments this run produced (the affected envs).
    A file present in a fragment takes that fragment's fresh command; every other
    file keeps its baseline command. So an affected run regenerates only the envs
    that changed and surgically replaces their entries, exactly like the coverage
    and report baselines.

Host-independence: the committed baseline stores `directory` (and any absolute
project-root prefix) as the token @ROOT@ so it never embeds a runner path and
never churns. gen_compiledb.sh expands @ROOT@ back to the real checkout root for
the copy the scanner actually reads. Native compile commands are otherwise
relative (`-Isrc`, `src/...`), so only `directory` needs tokenizing.

Usage: merge_compiledb.py <out_path> <fragments_glob> [--baseline <path>] [--root <abs>]
