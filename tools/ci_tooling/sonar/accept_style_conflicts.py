# Bulk-triage the SonarCloud code smells that conflict with this library's deliberate design
# (zero-heap, no-STL, terse C++11 - see docs/SONARQUBE.md), plus a few provable false positives.
#
# The free/public SonarCloud plan cannot assign a custom quality profile to the project, so
# per-issue marking is the only way to keep the board down to genuine reviewer signals. New code
# re-flags the same style rules, so re-run this after a scan.
#
# The genuine complexity / review rules are intentionally NOT touched, so they stay visible:
#   S134 (deep nesting), S3776 (cognitive complexity), S107 (too many params),
#   S5813 (bounds when computing string length). Fix real BUG/VULNERABILITY findings at source.
#
# Usage: SONAR_TOKEN=<token> python -m tools.ci_tooling.sonar.accept_style_conflicts [--dry-run]
