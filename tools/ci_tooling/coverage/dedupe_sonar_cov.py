"""dedupe_sonar_cov.py - collapse repeated lines in a SonarQube generic coverage report.

gcovr runs with --merge-mode-functions=separate so the two #if/#else definitions of one function
each keep the coverage their own envs measured. The same flag emits a header's inline lines once per
translation unit that included it, and SonarQube's generic format requires each line to appear once
per file - the whole report is rejected with "Error during parsing" when one does not.

This unions the repeats: a line is covered when any entry covered it, and the branch counts take the
highest pair seen. Function-level separation is untouched; only the per-line records the format
demands be unique are folded.

    python3 -m tools.ci_tooling.coverage.dedupe_sonar_cov test/coverage.xml

Idempotent, so it is safe to run over an already-clean report.
