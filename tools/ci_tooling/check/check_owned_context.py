"""Owner-context guard: fail if a library .cpp carries a loose file-scope mutable.

The library's security model (least privilege / object-capability) is that every
subsystem's mutable state lives in ONE owned, feature-gated context struct with internal
linkage (`static <name>_ctx s_x;` or the same inside an anonymous namespace), threaded
explicitly through the call graph. The only ambient symbols allowed at file scope are:

  * the single rooted owner instance(s)  -> a variable whose TYPE ends in `_ctx`
  * immutable data                       -> `const` / `constexpr`
  * functions, structs/enums, typedefs, using, templates, externs
  * the documented cross-TU shared substrate (the protocol-homogeneous pools), allow-listed

Anything else at file scope (a loose `static int s_foo;`, a scattered `Foo g_bar[N];`) is an
outlier and fails this check. Uniformity is the point: it is how the outliers get caught.

Heuristic, not a full C++ parser: file-scope definitions in this codebase sit at column 0
(whether `static` or inside an anonymous `namespace {`); struct members and function bodies
are indented, so a column-0 anchor separates them cleanly.
