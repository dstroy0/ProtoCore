"""Every translation unit under src/ is exercised by a named test env.

`src/` is protocol logic and nothing else, so every file in it runs on the host. The one
exemption is `src/board_drivers/`, which speaks to vendor SDKs and only runs on silicon.

The check is that a TU is named by at least one env's `build_src_filter` in
test/test_matrix.json. Being *compiled* is not the bar: 24 envs carry no filter at all and
so build the whole tree, which would mark every file covered while testing none of it
deliberately. A file named in a filter has a suite that chose to build it.

This is a ratchet (tools/ci_tooling/lib/baseline.py): the TUs that have no env today are recorded,
CI fails on a NEW one, and the floor drops as suites are added. A new module therefore
arrives with its `native_<name>` env or it does not merge - which is the rule
docs/SRCBANNED.md already states under "Required", now enforced instead of remembered.

Usage:
    python -m tools.ci_tooling.check.check_test_coverage           # fail on a TU with no env
    python -m tools.ci_tooling.check.check_test_coverage --list    # print the uncovered set
    python -m tools.ci_tooling.check.check_test_coverage --save    # re-record the floor
