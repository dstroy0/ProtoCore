"""The comment law, mechanically.

docs/SRCBANNED.md: "Code is math. The comment is the plain-language description of it.
What it does and how it does it. Not why it exists, not why it works, not what it is
not, not what it used to be, not a justification, not a tradeoff, not a measurement.
Nothing else ever goes in there."

check_src_banned.py exempts comments by design, so until now nothing enforced this and
72 sites accumulated. Two families dominate and both are regex-shaped: a benchmark
number quoted in a comment, and a sentence about code that is no longer there. A number
goes stale the moment the code or the compiler moves; a history clause describes
something a reader cannot see. Neither describes the code below it.

What is deliberately NOT flagged, because a checker cannot decide it: whether a
description is accurate, whether it is too long, or whether prose without one of these
markers is really a justification. Those stay review items.

Exempt: everything outside src/, which is the only tree walked - docs/, test/ (penetration_testing
and performance_benching with it), examples/, test/core_setup/; file-header Doxygen blocks;
@param / @return / @brief lines; SPDX and license headers; the PROTOCORE_ALLOW_* and NOSONAR
justification markers the other checkers require.
