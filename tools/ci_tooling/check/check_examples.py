"""Fail if example code - in a sketch OR in a README - drifts from the library API.

This exists because the drift already happened and nothing noticed. The sketches
were migrated to the library transport and to `enum class`, but the READMEs were
not, and the annotated-source blocks are hand-rolled on purpose (the annotation is
the teaching content, so they cannot be generated). The result:

  * 446 vendor calls across 83 READMEs - `#include <WiFi.h>`, `WiFi.localIP()`,
    `WiFi.setSleep()` - in blocks that claimed to reproduce sketches containing
    none of them.
  * 68 bare enum-class members across 22 READMEs, which do not compile at all.
  * 7 uses of `WiFiClient`, which docs/SRCBANNED.md rule 6 bans outright.

docs/SRCBANNED.md rule 6 already said "Applies to `examples/` too" and even printed
the command to run, but check_src_banned.py scans only `src/` and never reads
markdown. A rule that names its own scope is not enforced until a checker reads
that scope - so this reads it.

Checked (in `.ino`/`.cpp` and in README fenced code alike):
  1. vendor networking calls           - the library owns the transport
  2. banned socket classes (rule 6)    - WiFiClient / WiFiUDP / AsyncUDP

Usage:  python -m tools.ci_tooling.check.check_examples [--verbose]
