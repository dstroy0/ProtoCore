r"""Fail if a ``src/`` C/C++ file uses a construct banned by ``docs/SRCBANNED.md``.

This is the mechanical guardrail behind that checklist: the pre-commit hook runs it on the staged
``src/`` sources and refuses the commit if any banned construct appears, so a violation can never
land. It scans for the machine-detectable hard bans - unbounded ``strlen``, ``<stdlib.h>`` and its
heap / parse functions, the ``auto`` keyword, blocking ``delay()``, the non-reentrant ``gmtime`` /
``localtime`` / ``ctime`` / ``asctime`` family, em-dashes, runtime dispatch that is not resolvable
from the binary (ban #22: ``virtual``, class hierarchies, RTTI, ``std::function``), the conditional
expression (ban #23: ``?:`` anywhere in a code body), and mid-file
``#include`` (ban #17: any
``#include`` after code - every include must be hoisted to the top of the file; the sole exemption is a
justified ``// PC_ALLOW_LATE_INCLUDE:`` on an ordered include that derives from earlier macros).

Ban #5 (bare ``millis()``) is deliberately *not* enforced here: it is a "for new timing" rule, so a
whole-file scan cannot distinguish a new call from a grandfathered timing site, and the clock source
(``services/clock.h``) must call the platform ``millis()`` to provide ``pc_millis()``. It stays a
review item (``rg -n '\bmillis\s*\(' src/``) rather than a mechanical gate.

Comments and string / char literals are blanked out first (line numbers preserved), so a construct
merely *named* in a comment ("without <string.h> / strlen") is not a violation - only real code is.

Usage::

    python -m tools.ci_tooling.check.check_src_banned <file>...   # scan the given files (pre-commit: the staged set)
    python -m tools.ci_tooling.check.check_src_banned --all        # scan every C/C++ file under src/

Exit status is 1 if any violation is found (with a file:line report on stderr), else 0.
Only paths under ``src/`` are scanned; ``examples/`` and ``test/`` are exempt per docs/SRCBANNED.md.

# devirtualized, and a corrupted object turns every later call into an arbitrary jump. That is the
# same nondeterminism this library refuses everywhere else - fixed pools, compile-time sizing, a
# bounded worst case. RTTI is unbounded on top of it, and std::function type-erases through an
# allocation. Dispatch here is a function pointer in an owned context (ProtoHandler) or a spec/table

# load-bearing for control flow.

# The detector is the bare `?`, not a `? ... :` shape, and that is exact rather than approximate:
# comments and string/char literals are already blanked, and once they are gone `?` has exactly one

# test at the end rather than a truncation nobody notices. It also carries its own capacity,
