"""Primitives for writing generated regions into tracked documents.

Eleven generators had each reimplemented the same four steps: find the repo root,
locate a marked region, replace it, and support --check. The reimplementations did
not agree, and the disagreements were the bugs:

* Two incompatible answers to the prettier collision. prettier reformats markdown
  AFTER a generator runs, so a byte comparison in --check reports STALE forever.
  Three generators solved it by wrapping output in prettier-ignore fences (exact
  compare, still detects real drift); three others collapsed whitespace before
  comparing, which makes --check blind to the drift it exists to catch. Fences win,
  so that is what `Region` emits.

* Repo root by counting dirname levels. Nesting a script one directory deeper
  silently retargets it, which is how an asset generator once aimed above the repo
  root, and it broke six scripts again during the ci_tooling move. `repo_root()`
  searches for a marker instead, so depth stops mattering.

* CRLF handling present in nine files and absent in five.

`sub_once` is here for a different lesson: a `str.replace` that matches nothing
returns the original string, so a generator "succeeds" while shipping the stale
text it meant to fix. That happened to a README tagline, so the assertion is the
primitive, not the convention.
