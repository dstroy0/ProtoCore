"""A ratchet for rules the tree does not satisfy yet.

A checker written for an existing codebase has two bad options: stay out of CI until
the cleanup lands, so nothing stops the count growing, or fail the build immediately,
so someone disables it. Both end with the rule unenforced.

The third option is a recorded floor. `save()` writes today's violations; `filter_new()`
returns only the ones that are not in it. CI fails on new violations while the known
set is worked down, and re-running `save()` after a sweep lowers the floor. The count
can go down and never up.

Do not add an entry to a baseline to make a build pass. That is silencing an alarm
with extra steps, and it is the failure this file exists to make unnecessary - fixing
one violation is always available and always cheaper than arguing with the gate.

Both check_symbols.py and check_src_banned.py use this. It lives here because the
second checker to need a ratchet is the moment a second implementation gets written,
and two ratchets that disagree about what "known" means is worse than none.
