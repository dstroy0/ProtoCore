 * @file derived_sizing.h
 * @brief Feature-driven sizing resolution - the per-variant sizing layer's final pass.
 *
 * Some buffer sizes have a hard lower bound set by which features are compiled in, not by the
 * board. A ring smaller than that bound does not just waste a little RAM - it breaks the feature
 * (a handshake resets, a streamed upload deadlocks). That coupling is sizing logic, so it lives
 * here in the board-profile layer rather than inline in protocore_config.h, and it runs LAST: after
 * the chip/PSRAM/flash profiles, the base `#ifndef` defaults, and every `PC_ENABLE_*` feature
 * flag are resolved, so it can see the final values.
 *
 * The floor is enforced against whatever set the value - a chip profile, a `-D` build flag, or the
 * base default - by raising it to the feature minimum when it falls short (a monotone max, never a
 * lower). This is deliberately NOT gated on "was it a default?": a profile that pins RX_BUF_SIZE to
 * fit its DRAM must still be lifted to the streaming floor when streaming is built, or the pin
 * silently deadlocks large uploads. A value already at or above the floor is left untouched, so an
 * intentionally roomy ring is preserved.

// is refused forever and the handshake stalls to an idle-timeout RST - every 1.3-leading client
