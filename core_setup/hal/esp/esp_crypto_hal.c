 * @file esp_crypto_hal.c
 * @brief Real-HAL implementation: single-owner RSA/MPI accelerator, brought up by DIRECT register writes.
 *
 * Self-contained: uses only this HAL's own register map (esp_crypto_hal.h) and FreeRTOS for the one shared
 * exclusivity mutex - no `soc/` header, no `esp_mpi_*` / `mpi_hal_*` / `mpi_ll_*` symbol. The exclusivity
 * mutex must be ONE global instance shared by every translation unit that drives the accelerator, so
 * acquire/release live here (a header-only `static` would give each TU its own copy - not a lock).
 *
 * Bring-up is ON DEMAND and the peripheral is then LEFT running: a run of MODMULTs is stateless (each reloads
 * all operands), so re-resetting/power-cycling between ops is unnecessary - and, measured on-device, a per-op
 * power-cycle is not even deterministic (a re-init right after a teardown can return a wrong first result). We
 * bring up only when the peripheral is not already clocked+powered: at cold boot, or after another RSA-
 * peripheral user (e.g. mbedTLS RSA/DH) powered it down on its own teardown. Detection reads the clock-domain
 * registers (always accessible), never the possibly-unclocked RSA block.
